For information about the NMTC, please see entry, below. The CDFI Fund maintains a list of Census Tracts and their program eligibility or designation, based on income, poverty and unemployment data provided by the Census Bureau\u2018s 2011-2015 American Community Survey (ACS) for 2010 census tracts. During a one year transition period (until October 1, 2019), the designations based on 2006-2010 ACS data will remain in effect. For more on these programs users should consult the CDFI Fund website directly: www.cdfifund.gov.Designations are current as of October 2018, but may be changed at any time by the CDFI Fund. For this reason, users should verify eligibility directly with the CDFI Fund.

PolicyMap will remove this data in 2020 unless the dataset is updated or another source is found.",
