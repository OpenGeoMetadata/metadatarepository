  "dc_description_s": "PolicyMap created estimates of the average cost of public college in the United States using NCES\u2018s Integrated Postesecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data on 2-year and 4-year public institutions. For each institution category, the sum of the cost for in-state tuition, in-state fees, books and supplies, on-campus room and board, and other on-campus expenses was multiplied by the full-time undergraduate enrollment, using the total full-time enrollment within the state to calculate the state average. Institutions with either no full-time undergraduate enrollment, or no information for both in-state tuition and in-state fees were excluded from the calculations. Cost of public college data is based on a custom download of preliminary data from http:/ces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/InstitutionByName.aspx. It applies to the 2017-2018 school year and was downloaded in May, 2019.",
