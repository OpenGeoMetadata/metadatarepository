  "dc_description_s": "Feeding America first published the Map the Meal Gap project in 2011, using 2009 food insecurity data, to look at hunger on the state and local level. The data has since been collected annually. The project includes overall and child food insecurity, along with the percentages of food insecure individuals eligible for National Nutrition Assistance and other nutrition programs, their average cost per meal, and annual food-budget shortfalls. The poverty thresholds that determine SNAP and other nutrition program eligibility vary by state. Changes in state eligibility requirements limit year to year comparisons. More detail on how Feeding America obtained the data can be found in the technical brief located here: https://www.feedingamerica.org/research/map-the-meal-gap/how-we-got-the-map-data.",
