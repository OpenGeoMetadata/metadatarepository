HRRs represent regional health care markets, and were determined based on the locations of referrals for major cardiovascular surgeries and neurosurgery procedures. HSAs represent smaller, local health care markets, based on Medicare hospitalizations.HRR and HSA boundaries were created by the Dartmouth Atlas in 2005, based on contemporary hospital and Medicare data. Hospital Service Area boundaries are available only for the contiguous United States. Hospital Referral Region boundaries include Alaska and Hawaii.",
