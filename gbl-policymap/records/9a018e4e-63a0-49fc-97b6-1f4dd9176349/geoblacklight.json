  "dc_description_s": "This dataset, provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), identifies census tracts that meet or exceed HUD\u2018s established thresholds for racially and ethnically-concentrated areas of poverty (R/ECAPs). These tracts have a non-white population that is greater than or equal to 50% and meet either of the following poverty criteria: the poverty rate of a tract is 1) higher than 40% or 2) more than three times the average poverty rate of tracts in the metropolitan area. The racial/ethnic threshold is lowered to 20% for tracts that are located outside of metropolitan/micropolitan areas. HUD used component data from the decennial census (2010) and the American Community Survey (2009-2013) to determine which geographies met these criteria in 2010, and component data from Brown Longitudinal Tract Database, based on decennial census data from 2000 and 1990, to determine R/ECAP geographies for 1990 and 2000. HUD provides data from all years at the 2010 census tract boundaries. HUD recommends program participants identify R/ECAP areas in assessments of the barriers to fair and inclusive housing. For more information, see the HUD website subsection on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/affh/resources/.",
