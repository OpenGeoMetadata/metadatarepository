  "dc_description_s": "The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Lyme Disease Data comes from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and is provided through the CDC\u2018s Bacterial Diseases Branch. The data is available in 5-year intervals. Data are likely underreported, as is common with surveillance system data. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to the CDC, and some reported cases may be due to another cause. In highly endemic areas, under-reporting is more likely, and in non-endemic areas, over-reporting is likely. Data are captured individually by states, which may vary in ability to capture and classify cases, both state-to-state and year-to-year. The case definition for reporting Lyme Disease changed in 2008, so caution should be taken when comparing values before and after that time period. Data reported by county of residence, not county of exposure.",
