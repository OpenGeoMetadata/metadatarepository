According to the USDA, \u201cWatershed boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point.\u201cThe hydrologic units are nested in a hierarchical system, so basins are comprised of subbasins, subbasins, subbasins are comprised of watersheds, and watersheds are comprised of subwatersheds. The boundaries can assist in land use and water use planning.",
