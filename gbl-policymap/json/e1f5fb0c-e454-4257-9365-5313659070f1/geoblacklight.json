  "dc_description_s": "The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provides data for all U.S. credit unions as well as the addresses of credit union branches. These data are from the 5300 Call Report, submitted quarterly by credit unions to the NCUA, and downloaded in April 2019 from https://www.ncua.gov/analysis/Pages/call-report-data/quarterly-data.aspx. All information in this data, aside from office type and contact information, applies to the credit union and not the individual branch. Financial counseling/education, online banking, and percent loans delinquent were calculated by PolicyMap. PolicyMap geocoded all branch location points, and was able to locate 91% of the given addresses on a map.",
