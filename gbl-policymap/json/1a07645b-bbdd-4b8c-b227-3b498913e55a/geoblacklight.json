  "dc_description_s": "The HUD Initiative for Renewal Communities, Empowerment Zones, and Enterprise Communities (RC/EZ/EC) provided federal grants, tax incentives, and partnerships with government, for-profit, and non-profit entities to promote job creation and economic development in economically distressed communities. After the original authorization by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, which designated 9 empowerment zones and 95 enterprise communities, there were three rounds of community applications, culminating in extension of the benefits provided through the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000. Ultimately, 19 Enterprise, 67 Renewal, and 44 Empowerment communities were designated or extended between 1994 and 2011.",
