For more information about which centers are eligible for inclusion in the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator, please see SAMHSA\u2018s website: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/locator/about.PolicyMap also downloaded the geocoded locations of physicians certified to prescribe buprenorphine to combat opioid dependency from the SAMHSA Buprenorphine Treatment Physician Locator.
