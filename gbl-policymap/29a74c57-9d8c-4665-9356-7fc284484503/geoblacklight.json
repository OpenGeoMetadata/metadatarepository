  "dc_description_s": "The Energy Information Administration (EIA) U.S. Energy Mapping System provides the locations and capacity of operable electric generating plants which includes all plants that are operating, on standby, or short- or long-term out of service with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW or more. Generator-level data is collected as part of the EIA-860 Annual Electric Generator Report. Geographic coordinates are assigned to the plant locations in the source data.Thematic indicators of electricity generation capacity were determined based on a spatial join performed by PolicyMap of geocoded plant locations and standard Census geographic boundaries. Generator-level megawatt output capacity was aggregated for county and state boundaries.References in the data to \u201crenewable\u201cenergy sources refers to energy from biomass, hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar. This is consistent with how the EIA classifies renewable energy sources as outlined on their renewable sources webpage.",
