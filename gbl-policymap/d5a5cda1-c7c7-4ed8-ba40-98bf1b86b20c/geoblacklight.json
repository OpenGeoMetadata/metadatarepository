Also calculated was the sum of public transit rail stops within various distances of the centroid of the Census Tract. This representation of access to public transit is limited by the geographic coverage of Urban Mapping Inc. data, outlined in the entry for Urban Mapping below in the Data Directory. This analysis does not take into account physical barriers (eg, rivers, highways) that may make a transit stop inaccessible, nor a transit line\u2018s frequency or destination.",
