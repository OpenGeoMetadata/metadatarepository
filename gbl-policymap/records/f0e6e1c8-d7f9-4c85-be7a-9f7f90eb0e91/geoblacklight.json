  "dc_description_s": "The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was enacted by Congress in 1977, is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking operations. CRA requires that each insured depository institution\u2018s record in helping meet the credit needs of its entire community be evaluated periodically. That record is taken into account in considering an institution\u2018s application for deposit facilities, including mergers and acquisitions. CRA examinations are conducted by the federal agencies that are responsible for supervising depository institutions: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). PolicyMap extracted the database of lending activity from the Peer Small Business Data. PolicyMap aggregated the number of loans by amount of loan and by borrower revenue. PolicyMap also aggregated the number, average amount and percent of loans by top small business lenders and by top small farm lenders in order to construct categories that would be useful to policymakers and descriptive of neighborhoods and markets.When performing aggregations and calculations on the CRA data, averages were not calculated and percents were not computed where the denominator of the calculation was less than five. These places are identified on the map as having Insufficient Data. The 2004-2011 data is at the 2000 Census boundaries and the 2012-2016 data is at the 2010 boundaries. For percent changes, PolicyMap created a bridge table between 2000 and 2010 geographies in order to calculate previous years of data at 2010 Census boundaries. These previous years of data calculations are used for comparison to the current year of data.",
