For all tracts and block groups located within Census-defined metropolitan areas, this calculation is local median income as a share of metro-area median income. For tracts and block groups outside of Census-defined metro areas, this is local median income as a share of the non-metro state median income.PolicyMap has chosen specific breaks in the data, following on commonly used and understood guidelines. PolicyMap subscribers can edit the breaks in the ranges if some other set of breaks is preferred.Please be aware that the thresholds and data sources used in this calculation can vary, and federal agencies may require specific calculations for some program applications. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program defines low and moderate income tracts based on what percent of the population is low or moderate income, rather than by comparing median local values to the surrounding metro area (See HUD Community Development Block Grant Eligibility Criteria above). The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) specifies what years of income data to include in the calculation and 2000 data for local median income and 2004 data for area median income. (See Community Reinvestment Act Eligibility Criteria above).

The Hospitals are those facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid Services for individuals requiring temporary or long-term medical treatment. The Critical Access Hospitals are those institutions participating in Medicare and Medicaid and meeting the following requirements: being located in rural areas and being located more than 35 miles from any other Hospital or Critical Access Hospital, having no more than 25 inpatient beds and maintaining an average length of stay of 96 hours per patient for acute inpatient care, and providing 24 hour emergency care services.“Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)“(often referred to as “Community Health Centers“Â) receive funding under the Health Center Cluster federal grant program to provide care for underserved populations. The types of providers eligible include Community Health Centers, Migrant Health Centers, Health Care for the Homeless Programs, Public Housing Primary Care Programs, and care providers for some tribal organizations.On PolicyMap there is also a dataset called “Community Health Centers and Look-Alikes“Â, which PolicyMap downloads from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) website. This includes those receiving grants and community health centers that are eligible but not currently receiving grant funding. Although they are not receiving grants, these providers and or “look-alikes“and are eligible for some benefits including enhanced reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. Mapping both FQHCs and “look-alikes“might provide a fuller picture of the health-care safety net in a community.PolicyMap joins individual health center performance data to the Community Health Centers and Look-Alikes point dataset. HRSA tracks this performance data via the Uniform Data System (UDS), which is a reporting requirement for grantees of the following HRSA primary care programs, as defined in the Public Health Service Act: Community Health Center, Migrant Health Center, Health Care for the Homeless, Public Housing Primary Care. Because the UDS data is self-reported, some performance data did not match up with the Community Health Centers and Look-Alikes dataset, resulting in a 95.8% match. For information about health center performance data, see: https://bphc.hrsa.gov/datareporting/index.html.Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) are census tracts designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration as having too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty, and/or high elderly population. See: http://muafind.hrsa.gov/. Medically Underserved Populations (MUP) are areas where a specific population group is underserved, including groups with economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to primary medical care. If a population group does not meet the criteria for an MUP, but exceptional conditions exist which are a barrier to health services, they can be designated with a recommendation from the state‘s Governor.Due to what HRSA terms a “source data error“Â, some areas have multiple designations. In these instances, if any designation is MUA, MUA is shown on the map. If MUP and Governor are designated for a single area, MUP is shown. If multiple IMU scores are provided, the lowest score is shown on the map. Although MUA and MUP data is shown on PolicyMap at the tract level, it is provided by HRSA at the tract, county, and minor civil division (MCD). County and MCD level data is shown at the tract level. In cases where a tract was only partially covered by an applicable MCD, it was labeled as not being an MUA or MUP.The data layers on PolicyMap related to health care professions, health facilities, and hospital utilization are all from HRSA‘s Area Health Resource File (AHRF). This data is compiled by HRSA from multiple original data sources, which means that different indicators are available for different years.

9d6a80ee-355f-4033-a0c4-11378ef8f3b6,HUD‘s Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) Physical Inspection Scores,"HUD‘s Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) conducts physical property inspections of roughly 20,000 properties owned, insured or subsidized by HUD per year. The purpose of these inspections is to make sure that assisted families are provided with decent, safe and sanitary housing in good repair. The data currently available include multifamily inspections conducted from 2005 to February 2015 and public housing inspections conducted from 2005 to February 2015. Inspected properties receive an overall score from 0 to 100 based on five criteria: site, building exterior, building systems, common areas and units. Multifamily inspections note whether a site has health and safety violations or smoke detector issues.The REAC score received by the property sets its “standard“and dictates how often HUD will return to evaluate the property:A score of 90 points or higher is designated a Standard 1 and required to undergo a physical inspection once every three years. A score between 80 and 89 is designated a Standard 2 and required to undergo a physical inspection once every two years.A score of less than 80 points is designated a Standard 3 and required to undergo an annual physical inspection.Standard 3 performing properties with scores below 60 are referred to HUD Departmental Enforcement Center.PolicyMap downloads geocoded data on HUD‘s multifamily and public housing sites from three different resources at HUD and wherever possible PolicyMap linked the data using the property ID.

fa100631-d0a3-4d53-bcf0-e12f5919fad3,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,"The data was estimated using data from the CDC‘s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and data from the 2012 Census American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. The BRFSS survey responses are collected through state-based telephone surveys. State estimates are calculated using CDC‘s recommended weighting methodology. The values for counties, county subdivisions, census tracts, and places in this data are estimates based on a multilevel model with post-stratification based on metropolitan area status, race, age, and income characteristics. The model formula is based on state-level estimates as well as the following state- and individual-level characteristics: age group, income level, racial/ethnic group, and metropolitan area status. Predicted responses were then post-stratified using 2013 American Community Survey household population estimates for income, age, and racial/ethnic groups. Metropolitan area status is based on 2009 Metropolitan and Micropolitan Census delineations, available here: https://www.census.gov/population/metro/data/defhist.html.Fruit and Vegetable Intake: For fruit and vegetable indicators, respondents were asked how many times per day, week, or month they consumed fruit and vegetables, including 100 percent pure fruit juices, fresh fruit, frozen fruit, canned fruit, cooked or canned beans, dark green vegetables, orange-colored vegetables, and other vegetables not including fried potatoes. CDC recommends that about 1 cup of fruit and 1.25 cups of vegetables be included in every 1,000 calories an individual consumes. For example, a moderately active 45-year-old female should consume 5.5 cups (servings) of fruit and vegetables per dayDiabetes and Related Risk Factors: BRFSS includes questions on diabetes and related risk factors, including body mass index (BMI) classification and physical activity. Respondents were considered to have diabetes if they responded “yes“ to the question “Has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes?“ Women who only had diabetes during pregnancy were not included. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are included. Respondents were considered obese if their BMI (as determined by height and weight) was 30 or greater. CDC recommends that adults engage in 150 minutes of physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week, as well as at least two muscle strengthening activities per week. Respondents were asked to list their most frequently-engaged-in physical activities and estimate the number of minutes per week or month spent doing each. Physical activities were classified as “aerobic“ or “vigorous“ based on metabolic equivalent (MET) values. Respondents were considered to be physically inactive if they answered “no“to the question, “During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?“Chronic Conditions: The BRFSS survey asks respondents their health status for common chronic conditions. Respondents were asked if a doctor, nurse, or other health professional has ever told them they had the condition. Chronic health conditions selected for PolicyMap include asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), depression, high cholesterol, hypertension (high blood pressure), and stroke. COPD, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis are grouped together due to high comorbidity among these conditions. To calculate the estimated asthma rate, survey responses are limited to adults who have been told they currently have asthma; respondents indicating they have formerly received an asthma diagnosis are not included. Access to Health Care: Survey respondents were asked to report on their access to, and utilization of, health care resources. Respondents were asked to report if there was one person they consider to be their personal doctor or health care provider. To calculate the personal doctor indicator, responses of “Yes, only one“and “More than one“were included. Regular health screenings are recommended by CDC to diagnose and prevent health conditions. Respondents were asked to indicate the length of time since their last routine physical exam or checkup (not an exam for a specific injury, illness, or condition); responses of 12 months or fewer were used to calculate the annual checkup indicator. Respondents were asked if they had received the flu vaccine in the past 12 months, including a shot in the arm or intradermal injection; and nasal spray, mist, or drop. Since 2010, CDC has recommended that all adults be vaccinated for the flu, particularly those at risk of serious complications. To assess the HIV test rate, the BRFSS survey has respondents state if they have ever been tested for HIV. Respondents were asked not to count tests that were part of a blood donation.Self-Assessed Health: To determine self-assessed (perceived) health, respondents were asked to rate their overall health as poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent. Self-assessed health status can be a reliable estimate of population health and well-being. As a measure of health-related quality of life, the BRFSS survey also measures healthy days for physical and mental health. Respondents were asked how many days out of the past 30 their physical health was not good (days of physical illness and/or injury); and separately for how many days their mental health was not good (days experiencing stress, depression, and/or problems with emotions). To create unhealthy days indicators, PolicyMap calculated the percentage of respondents who answered “seven or more“days out of the past 30 days. Though there are no standard cutpoints for mentally and physically unhealthy days, health problems at least seven days per month can be considered serious or severe. Experiencing fourteen or more mentally unhealthy days per month constitutes “frequent mental distress.“ÂHealth-Risk Behaviors: Health-risk behaviors are those that contribute to negative health outcomes, such as illness or injury. BRFSS includes questions relating to use of tobacco and alcohol products, as well as seatbelt use. Risk behaviors can be underreported due to social desirability bias in response to survey questions.To calculate current smoker status, respondents were asked to indicate if they now smoke cigarettes “every day,““some days,“or “not at all.“Current smokers are considered those who smoke at least some days. Respondents were also asked if they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes (equivalent to five packs) in their lifetime. Current or former smoking status is associated with negative health outcomes. Consumption of alcoholic beverages was assessed by asking respondents how many drinks they consumed during the past 30 days. A drink is equivalent to a 12-ounce beer, 5-ounce glass of wine, or single shot of liquor. The definitions of heavy drinking and binge drinking differ for males and females: heavy drinking for men is more than two drinks per day, and one or more drinks per day for women; binge drinking refers to 5 or more drinks per occasion for men, and four or more drinks per occasion for women. To assess seatbelt use, respondents were asked to estimate how often they use seatbelts when driving or riding in a car: always, nearly always, sometimes, seldom, or never. Estimates are based on the number who responded “always“to this question.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-fa100631-d0a3-4d53-bcf0-e12f5919fad3,Tabular Data,English,Center for Disease Control (CDC),Health|Health-risk Behavior|Diabetes and Related Risk Factors|Fruit And Vegetable Consumption|Physical Health|Mental Health|Health Care,PolicyMap,2013,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2013,1.0,GeoBlacklight

070ab000-30d4-4e54-bc62-a7834245158f,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Opioid Overdose Prevention,"CDC prescription data comes from the QuintilesIMS Transactional Data Warehouse, which is based on a sample of approximately 59,000 retail (non-hospital) pharmacies that dispense roughly 88% of all retail prescriptions in the U.S. This database includes initial and refill prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies but does not include mail order prescriptions. Prescriptions include those purchased through commercial insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, or cash or its equivalent.Opioid prescriptions include butrans (buprenorphine), codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, propoxyphene, tapentadol, and tramadol. Cough and cold formulations containing opioids and buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist used for treatment of opioid use disorder as well as for pain, are not included. In addition, methadone dispensed through methadone maintenance treatment programs is not included.Opioid prescription rates per 100 persons are calculated using population estimates from the Population Estimates Program, U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, 2000and2010 Intercensal Estimates of the Resident Population for Counties and States were used for 2006and2010 rate calculations and 2010and2016 Postcensal Estimates of the Resident Population for Counties and National were used for 2011and2016 rate calculations. After a steady increase in overall opioid prescribing rates from 2006, total opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012 at 255 million and a rate of 81.3 prescriptions per 100 people. The rate does not represent the percent of the population receiving opioid prescriptions. Since an individual may receive multiple prescriptions in a year, many counties have rates that are greater than 100 prescriptions per 100 persons.Data is available for over 85% of all U.S. counties. Counties displayed as having insufficient data may indicate counties with no retail pharmacies, counties where no retail pharmacies were sampled, or counties where the prescription volume was erroneously attributed to an adjacent, more populous county according to the sampling rules used.This data differs from the data shown in the July 2017 issue of CDC Vital Signs, which featured different facets of opioid prescribing from 2006 to 2015.

c445a41b-a8a2-448c-9d2b-97f770a976cd,Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP),"The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) is a Federal-State-Industry partnership, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), that brings together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associates, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national resource of encounter-level healthcare data. Due to limited geographic coverage for 2017 this data is not displayed on PolicyMap, but will be added once a larger data sample has been collected.HCUP opioid-related hospital use includes both hospital inpatient stays, recorded as hospital discharges, and emergency department (ED) visits. Each discharge or visit is recorded as a separate event, regardless of how many times an individual patient may visit a hospital in a year. Inpatient stays are when patients are admitted to and treated in community hospitals. Community hospitals are defined as short-term, non-Federal, general, and other hospitals, excluding hospital units of other institutions (e.g., prisons). Included among community hospitals are obstetrics and gynecology, otolaryngology, orthopedic, cancer, pediatric, public, and academic medical hospitals. Excluded are community hospitals that are also long-term care facilities such as rehabilitation, psychiatric, and alcoholism and chemical dependency hospitals. ED visits are defined as treat-and-release hospital encounters (i.e., they do not result in a hospital admission to the same hospital). The number of inpatient stays and ED visits are adjusted to account for missing data.Inpatient stays and ED visits for opioid-related hospital use include both opioid-related disorders and opioid poisoning and other adverse effects. Specifically, hospital discharges and ED visits related to opioid use were identified by any diagnosis in the following ranges of ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM codes: F11 series (except F11.21); T40 series (0X1, 0X4, 0X5, 1X1, 1X4, 2X1, 2X4, 2X5, 3X1, 3X4, 3X5, 4X1, 4X4, 4X5, 601, 604, 605, 691, 694, 695); 304.00-304.02; 304.70-304.72; 305.50-305.52; 965.00-965.02; 965.09; 970.1; E850.0-E850.2; E935.0-E935.2; E940.1. Inpatient stays and ED associated with multiple opioid diagnosis codes are only recorded once. For more information on these codes and how they changed from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes, please visit https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/datainnovations/ICD-10CaseStudyonOpioid-RelatedIPStays042417.pdf Age refers to the age of the patient at admission. Discharges or visits missing age are excluded from results reported by age.Income is based on the median household income of the patient‘s ZIP Code of residence. Quartiles are defined so that the total U.S. population is evenly distributed across four groups. The value ranges for the national income quartiles vary by year. Income quartile is missing if the patient is homeless or foreign.Patient location is based on the National Center for Health Statistics scheme to study the relationship between urbanization and health. For this dataset, there are five categories: large central metropolitan (counties in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of 1 million or more population that contain the entire population of the largest principal city of the MSA, have their entire population contained in the largest principal city of the MSA, or contain at least 250,000 inhabitants of any principal city of the MSA); large fringe metropolitan (suburbs) (counties in MSAs of 1 million or more population that did not qualify as large central metropolitan counties); medium metropolitan (counties in MSAs of populations of 250,000 to 999,999); small metropolitan (counties in MSAs of population less than 250,000); and rural (comprised of counties in micropolitan statistical areas and nonmetropolitan counties that did not qualify as micropolitan).Information about insurance type is a hospital‘s response to the question, “Who is expected to pay the hospital for a given service?“Â, which may be different than the actual means of payment. Expected primary payers include: Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured. Discharges and ED visits with other, missing, or invalid expected primary payer are not reported in Fast Stats reporting by payer. These excluded records typically represent approximately 3 to 6 percent of all discharges or visits. Discharges with the expected primary payer of self-pay, charity, and no charge are classified as uninsured. For HCUP Partner organizations that identify State and local programs serving low-income, uninsured populations (e.g., Indian Health Services, county indigent, migrant health programs, Ryan White Act, Hill-Burton Free Care), discharges for these payers also are classified as uninsured. About one-third of the HCUP Partner organizations include this level of detail in their coding of expected payer.The rate of inpatient stays and rate of ED visits are calculated per 100,000 people (U.S. residents). Population-based rates are presented for trends of opioid-related inpatient stays and ED visits reported overall and by age, community-level income, and patient location. HCUP uses population and demographic data from Claritas, a vendor that compiles U.S. Census Bureau data. Rates are not calculated for expected payer (insurance type) because there is no current source of national population insurance estimates that align with HCUP‘s definition of expected primary payer.For more information on the data and methodology visit https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/faststats/OpioidUseServlet.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/faststats/OpioidUseServlet,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-c445a41b-a8a2-448c-9d2b-97f770a976cd,Tabular Data,English,Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project,Health|Opioid Hospitalizations And Emergency Department Visits,PolicyMap,2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2016,1.0,GeoBlacklight

The SBA is a standards-based test, which means it measures specific skills defined for each grade by the state of Alaska. The goal is for all students to score at or above the proficient level. AK High School Graduation Qualifying Exam(HSGQE): In 2013-2014 Alaska used the High School Graduation Qualifying Examination (HSGQE) to test students in grade 10 in reading, writing and math. In some cases students may repeat the test during grades 11 or 12. The HSGQE is a standards-based test, which means that it measures how well students are mastering specific skills defined by the state of Alaska. The HSGQE is a high school graduation requirement. The goal is for all students to score at or above the proficient level.Alaska Measure of Progress(AMP): The Alaska Department of Education administered AMP (Alaska Measures of Progress) for the first time in spring of 2015. Previously, students in grades 3-10 took the Standards Based Assessments (SBAs). AMP is aligned to Alaska‘s English Language Arts and Mathematics Standards, which are much more rigorous than the Grade Level Expectations on which the SBAs were based. Because the two assessments measure very different standards, under no circumstances should the results be compared between these two assessments.AlabamaAL Alabama High School Graduation Exam(AHSGE): In 2012-2013 Alabama used the Alabama High School Graduation Exam (AHSGE) to test high school students in reading, math, language, biology and social studies. High school students must pass the AHSGE in order to graduate. The AHSGE is a standards-based test, which means it measures specific skills defined for each grade by the state of Alabama. The goal is for all students to pass the test.AL Reading and Mathematics Test(ARMT): In 2012-2013 Alabama used the Alabama Reading and Mathematics Test (ARMT) to test students in grades 3 through 8 in reading and math. The ARMT is a standards-based test, which means it measures specific skills defined for each grade by the state of Alabama. The goal is for all students to score at or above the state standard.AL Alabama Science Assessment(ASA): In 2013-2014 Alabama used the Alabama Science Assessment (ASA) to test students in grades 5 and 7 in science.

BRIC was developed by the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. HVRI provides training, research, outreach, and leadership pertaining to the field of hazard vulnerability and resilience.BRIC considers six categories of disaster resilience: social, economic, infrastructural, community capital, institutional, and environmental. The US National Academy of Science defines disaster resilience as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events. Such events may include floods or hurricanes in the context of BRIC. Overall resilience scores are calculated at the county level by summing category scores. BRIC can be used to compare resilience across counties, monitor county resilience over time, and identify specific attributes of resilient communities.The primary data source for BRIC is the Census American Community Survey. The variables used for each category of disaster resilience are listed below, followed by a list of the data sources: Category Variables:Social Resilience: absolute difference between percent population over 25 with college education and percent population over 25 with less than high school education (inverted), percent population below 65 years of age, percent households with at least one vehicle, percent households with telephone service available, percent population proficient in English, percent population without sensory, physical, or mental disability, percent population under age 65 with health insurance, psychosocial support facilities per 10,000 persons, food security rate, physicians per 10,000 persons.Economic Resilience: percent owner-occupied housing units, labor force employed, gini coefficient (inverted), percent employees not in farming, fishing, forestry, extractive industry, or tourism, absolute difference between male and female median income (inverted), ratio of large to small businesses, large retail stores per 10,000 persons, percent labor force employed by federal government.Infrastructural Resilience: percent housing units not mobile homes, percent vacant housing units that are for rent, number hospital beds per 10,000 persons, major road egress points per 10,000 persons, percent housing units built prior to 1970 or after 2000, number hotels/motels per 10,000 persons, number public schools per 10,000 persons, rail miles per square mile, percent population with access to broadband internet service.Community capital Resilience: percent population not foreign-born persons who came to US within previous 5 years, percent population born in state of current residence, percent voting age population participating in recent election, number affiliated with a religious organization per 10,000 persons, number civic organizations per 10,000 persons, number Red Cross volunteers per 10,000 persons, number Red Cross training workshop participants per 10,000 persons.Institutional Resilience: ten year average per capita spending for mitigation projects, percent housing units covered by National Flood Insurance Program, distance from count seat to state capital (inverted), distance from county seat to nearest county seat within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (inverted), number governments and special districts per 10,000 persons (inverted), number Presidential Disaster Declarations divided by number of loss-causing hazard events for ten year period, percent population in communities covered by Citizen Corps programs, population change over previous five-year period (inverted), percent population within 10 miles of nuclear power plant, crop insurance policies per square mile.Environmental Resilience: farms marketing products through Community Supported Agriculture per 10,000 persons, percent land in wetlands, megawatt hours per energy consumer (inverted), average percent perviousness, Water Supply Stress Index (inverted).Data Sources:",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/geog/hvri/bric,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-8558c906-99f7-4a9b-b67f-511a8db3d8b0,Tabular Data,English,University of South Carolina Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute,Society|Disaster Risk|Resilience,PolicyMap,2010|2015,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2015,1.0,GeoBlacklight
cab15483-7825-40f4-99f0-488444b15336,Census County Business Patterns,"County Business Pattern Data (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry. The data describe the number and type of jobs that are located in any given place. This is different from describing the occupations of people living in the same area.CBP covers most of the country‘s economic activity. The series excludes data on self-employed individuals, employees of private households, railroad employees, agricultural production employees, and most government employees.CBP data are extracted from the Business Register, the Census Bureau‘s file of all known single and multi-establishment companies. The Company Organization Survey (annual) and Economic Censuses (every five years) provide individual establishment data for multi-location firms. Data for single-location firms are obtained from various surveys conducted by the Census Bureau, such as the Economic Censuses, the Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and Current Business Surveys, as well as from administrative records of the Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Jobs in the CBP data are reported by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, pronounced “Nakes“Â) categories. NAICS is the standard for use by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the national business economy. NAICS is run through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and, in 1997, replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Business establishments self-assign their NAICS code based on the primary economic activities in which they engage. CBP data is given using two different methodologies. At the county, CBSA, state, and nation level, values are given for the number of employees in a given industry. These values are infused with noise added by the Census in order to avoid disclosing data that would be identifiable to a specific employer. In addition, some values are withheld by the Census to avoid disclosing data for individual companies. In these cases, the Census provides a range within which the value falls, but these are not included on PolicyMap, and are shown as Insufficient Data.On PolicyMap, the data is also given as an “estimate“Â. For each industry, at every geography, (including Zip code) CBP provides values for the number of establishments that fall in various ranges of number of employees. These ranges are 1-4 employees, 5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999, and 1000 or more. There are additional higher ranges at the county and CBSA level. PolicyMap takes the midpoint of each range (so, for 10-19 it would be 14.5) and multiplies that by the number of establishments. Establishments with 1,000 or more employees are given a value of 1,750. This number for each range is added together to get the estimate. Though this number is less precise, its advantages are that there are no longer suppressions (so there is better coverage on the map), and ZIP code data is included.Number of establishments is also provided for three industries relating to health: Fitness and Recreational Sports Centers; Beer, Wine, and Liquor Stores; and Limited-Service Restaurants.

Available on PolicyMap are grocery stores (i.e., stores in the TDLinx grocery trade channel, as well as dollar stores from the mass merchandiser channel), including their name, address, Reinvestment Fund-defined service level (i.e., full-service or limited-service), and store type.The points displayed on PolicyMap for a given year represent the stores that were open at any point during that year, as calculated by Reinvestment Fund using TDLinx data.Reinvestment Fund classifies conventional supermarkets, limited-assortment supermarkets, natural/gourmet supermarkets, supercenters, and warehouse grocery stores with at least 5,000 square feet selling space as full service. Reinvestment Fund manually validated stores of these types with less than 5,000 square feet selling space to confirm that they offer a full range of fresh and healthy foods; stores that do offer a full range of fresh and healthy foods, and stores for which it was not possible to make a determination, are classified as limited-service. Superettes and dollar stores are classified as limited-service because a review of relevant research shows that they generally offer a narrower variety of fresh and healthy foods at generally higher prices than do supermarkets. Conventional club stores are classified as limited-service because they require paid memberships. Military commissaries are classified as limited-service because they are not open to the public.Store types presented on PolicyMap are derived from Nielsen TDLinx sub-channels. Nielsen TDLinx uses official industry-standard definitions for each trade channel and sub-channel when available and rigorous developed definitions when not. Industry endorsement and support of these definitions has come from Trade Associations like The Food Marketing Institute (FMI), Grocery Manufacturers of America (GMA), and National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), as well as Trade Publications like Convenience Store News and Progressive Grocer. Nielsen store type definitions and example stores are provided below. Conventional SupermarketA conventional supermarket is a traditional full-line, self-service grocery store with annual sales volume of $2 million or more. This definition applies to individual stores regardless of total company size or sales, and therefore includes both chain and independent locations. Examples: Kroger, Food Lion, IGA, Cub FoodsLimited Assortment SupermarketA limited assortment supermarket has a limited selection of items in a reduced number of categories. These stores typically offer everyday low pricing. Principal differentiation from a conventional supermarket is often in the reduced size and completeness of produce and non-food categories such as Health and Beauty Care (HBC), cleaning supplies, paper products and general merchandise products. A limited assortment supermarket has few, if any, full service departments, and less product variety and customer service than a conventional supermarket. Limited Assortment stores will occasionally have an annual sales volume of less than $2MM. Examples: Aldi Food Store, Save A LotNatural/Gourmet SupermarketA natural or gourmet foods supermarket is a self-service grocery store primarily offering natural, organic, or gourmet foods. These stores will either focus product offerings around healthy living with fresh produce and natural products, or around gourmet food preparations with upscale oils, spices, cheeses, meats and produce. Natural/gourmet foods supermarkets typically have expanded fresh foods departments and/or prepared food selections. These supermarkets also typically have a limited, if any, health and beauty care and general merchandise selection. A Natural/Gourmet supermarket does not have over 50% of product offerings in one category, as is the case with traditional butcher shops, delis, produce stands, or nutritional supplement stores. Natural/Gourmet stores will occasionally have an annual sales volume of less than $2MM. Examples: Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Dean & DeLuca. Note: Ethnic supermarkets do not qualify as Natural/Gourmet Foods supermarkets.SupercenterA supercenter is a retail unit with a full-line supermarket and a full-line discount merchandiser under one roof.

93889603-1b20-4c1c-8daf-f145686e1ba9,IRS Statistics of Income and Migration Data,"The Internal Revenue Service‘s Statistics of Income (IRS SOI) division produces annual estimates of migration flows using domestic and foreign tax returns. Returns are matched to returns from the previous year using the primary tax filer‘s social security number. If the address associated with the return is located in a different county than the previous year, the return is identified as a migrant. In-migrants are those who filed tax returns in different counties, states, or abroad in the previous year but filed locally in the current year; out-migrants filed taxes locally in the previous year but filed in different counties, states, or abroad for the current year.Individual taxpayers cannot be identified, either directly or indirectly, from these tabulations. The data released by the IRS for these calculations have undergone suppression procedures to ensure no inappropriate disclosure of information.There are two limitations to the completeness of that data that should be considered when using IRS migration data. First, up to the 2009-2010 time period, the data only capture returns processed by late September of the year following the tax year, which covers roughly 95-98 percent of all returns. Second, those who are not required to file tax returns are not counted by the IRS, so lower income people and senior citizens are likely underrepresented.Beginning with 2010-2011, the IRS began using full-year tax return instead of partial-year. Overall, this increases the number of returns by 5 percent, and high-income returns by approximately 25 percent. Caution should be exercised in making comparisons across this time period. More information is available here: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/soi-a-inmig-id1509.pdf. Data from the IRS is given for the year of the tax filing; people generally file their returns the year following the tax year (tax year 2013 returns are filed in 2014).

9175998e-6ec7-4baf-a8d4-762a94f5543c,Census: Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS),"Demographic data for 2000 is from the U.S. Bureau of the Census‘Summary File 3 (SF3). This dataset is derived from the longer version ""long form"" of the household survey that takes place every ten years. SF3 data include information on housing conditions as well as characteristics of the household and its members.Demographic data for 2008-2012 and 2013-2017 is from the U.S. Bureau of the Census‘American Community Survey (ACS). This survey has replaced the long form from the Decennial Census for 2010. Rather than distributing both a short survey and the long form in 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau instead distributed the short survey as the Decennial Census. Beginning in 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau began administering the new ACS Survey, which is comprised of many of the questions from the old Census long form. With the release of the 2005-2009 ACS data, the ACS data includes small geographic estimates. The ACS data provides demographic, social, economic and housing characteristic estimates on a rolling basis (from 2008-2012 and 2013-2017), whereas the 2010 Decennial Census provides counts of the population and their basic characteristics (sex, age, race, Hispanic origin, and homeowner status) as a snapshot in time (2010). The move from the long form on the Decennial Census to the ACS format allows data consumers to enjoy annually updated detailed population characteristics, rather than having to wait for the Decennial Census data release. The ACS differs from the Decennial Census in that it is not an enumeration of the population, however. Instead, the Census Bureau collects ACS data from a sample of the population, and it provides a margin of error for every ACS estimate. Margins of error are not shown on PolicyMap, but users are encouraged to visit the Census‘website with questions about ACS estimates shown on PolicyMap.PolicyMap displays the 2008-2012 and 2013-2017 ACS data and the 2010 SF1 data using the Census‘2010 geographic file boundaries. PolicyMap shows the 2000 SF3 data using the Census‘2000 geographic file boundaries. Because the 2000 and 2010 TIGER file boundaries are not identical, users will likely see differences in boundary areas when toggling from data at the 2000 geographic file boundaries to data at the 2010 geographic file boundaries. For places, counties and county subdivisions, PolicyMap employed a Census-provided bridge table in order to calculate percent changes. PolicyMap also employed a Census-provided bridge table to relate 2000 census tracts to 2010 census tracts for percent change calculations. In the case of block groups, PolicyMap created a bridge table to relate the 2000 Census SF3 data to the 2010 Census boundaries. The bridge table was created by first allocating 2000 block counts to their correspective 2010 blocks using a family, household, or population multiplier. Then, after employing the Census-provided 2000 block to 2010 block table, PolicyMap summed the 2000 block estimates to 2010 Census boundary block groups. For percent change calculations for medians, PolicyMap calculated 2000 medians at the 2010 Census boundaries by creating component buckets of values using the Census 2000 count data at the 2010 Census boundaries and deriving the median from those counts.Data is shown at the Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level. ZCTAs are based on US Postal Service ZIP Codes, but they are not identical, and in many cases, may be significantly different. Though ZIP Codes change continuously, ZCTAs are set in 2010, and remain unchanged throughout the decade. Data shown for ZCTAs represent the information in the ZCTA area, not the ZIP Code. More information on ZCTAs can be found here: https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.Demographic data for 2010 is from the U.S. Bureau of the Census‘Summary File 1 (SF1). This dataset comprises what previously was referred to as the shorter version (“short form“Â) of the household survey that takes place every ten years. The SF1 data represents the count of every resident in the United States, mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. These counts determine the number of seats per state in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is also used to distribute federal funds at the sub-state level.

After a governor seeks a presidential disaster declaration, FEMA conducts a preliminary damage assessment before recommending a decision to the president. Factors influencing the declaration of a federal disaster include the amount and type of damage, impact on infrastructure or critical facilities, imminent threats to health and public safety, impacts to essential government services and functions, unique capability of the Federal government to provide resources and available assistance from other sources, dispersion or concentration of damage, level of local insurance coverage, state and local resource commitments from previous events, and the frequency of recent disaster events. FEMA provides disaster funding though four programs: Individuals and Households, Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation. For more information on the programs, visit FEMA‘s website. Each declaration area is assigned a sequential disaster number. Disaster numbers are unique to states. Disasters indicate both the dates the incident itself began and ended, as well as the date of the disaster declaration and the date all financial transactions for all programs are completed (the closeout date).

The Atlas contains data about food access and can be used for determining eligibility for HFFI funds.Low access is defined as being far from a supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store. A census tract has low access status if a certain number of share of individuals in the tract live far from a supermarket. There are various measures for distance from a supermarket that this data uses. The original Food Desert Locator (which this replaces) defined low access as living 1 mile away from a supermarket in urban areas, and 10 miles away in rural areas. This study adds measures for 0.5 miles in urban areas, and 20 miles in rural areas. Using these distance measurements, a census tract is defined as low access if there are at least 500 people or 33 percent of the population within the tract with low access.To assemble the data, the country is divided into 0.5-km grids, and data on population are aerially allocated to the grids. Distance to the nearest supermarket is measured for each grid cell by calculating the distance between the geographic center of the .5-km grid and the center of the grid with the nearest supermarket. The numbers are then aggregated to the census-tract level.Low-income tracts are defined as where the tract‘s poverty rate is greater than 20 percent, the tract‘s median family income (MFI) is less than or equal to 80 percent of the statewide MFI, or the tract is in a metropolitan area and has an MFI less than or equal to 80 percent of the metropolitan area‘s MFI.

PolicyMap‘s vacancy data from Valassis Lists contains combined data from two distinct data products: vacancy and no-stat counts for business and residential addresses from the United States Postal Service (USPS), and the USPS Computerized Delivery Sequence (CDS). These data reflect a point-in-time snapshot of vacancy at the end of each quarter. The data do not include a measure of how long an individual address has been vacant or no-stat. Downloading Valassis Lists data from PolicyMap in any format is prohibited.Vacant addresses are those where mail has not been collected for at least 90 days (and typically for no more than 9 months). No-stat addresses include inactive addresses that are under construction, demolished, blighted, or are otherwise unable to receive postal mail. Rural route addresses that are vacant for more than 90 days are also classified as no-stat.For vacancy and no stat counts, PolicyMap aggregated address-level data, provided by Valassis Lists, to the block group level and higher geographies. PO Boxes addresses and addresses classified by USPS as deleted were not included in the aggregations. For counts of the total number of residential and business postal address, PolicyMap used block group level counts from the CDS database, as provided by Valassis Lists. PO Boxes addresses and addresses classified by USPS as deleted were not included. Because of discrepancies between data sources, some block groups may show vacant or no-stat addresses in excess of the total number of addresses from CDS.PolicyMap aggregated the block group values provided by the source to larger geographies. In some cases, Valassis Lists could not assign vacancy and no-stat values to a valid block group. In some cases, the address could not be accurately geo-located by the source, resulting in an incomplete census identifier. For zip+4 or zip code matches, an exact block group could not always be determined if the block group code assigned to the address is located in a different county than the zip code. For 2019 Q1 data, about 1.4% of vacant residential addresses, 1.2% of business vacancies, and 18.1% of no-stat addresses in the original data could not be matched due to these geocoding issues. Rural areas show more geocoding anomalies than urban areas. The values from these unmatched block group records are included in county, CBSA and state records, depending on availability.

56744f50-5bba-4630-be19-8ed414d93210,FFIEC: HMDA (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act),"The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), which was enacted by Congress in 1975, requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan areas to collect data about their housing-related lending activity, report the data annually to the government, and make the data publicly available. The public database of lending activity is called Loan Application Register and Transmittal Sheets (LARS & TS). PolicyMap aggregated originated purchase and refinance loans for owner-occupied, one-to-four family dwellings, in order to construct categories that would be useful to policymakers and descriptive of neighborhoods and markets, such as Prime Refinance Loans, or Purchase Loans to African Americans.PolicyMap contains HMDA data for 2004 through 2016. All high-cost (those with a reported rate spread) and prime loans for 2015 reflect the reporting rule changes implemented in 2009Q4, discussed below. In order to accurately display the data according to these rule adjustments, PolicyMap divided the 2009 data into 2009Q1-2009Q3 and 2009Q4. The reason for this is that in the fourth quarter of 2009, HMDA changed its rules for reporting rate spreads in an effort to more accurately capture the current high-cost lending activity. Change calculations between previous years and 2009 through 2016 should not be made due to the change in HMDA‘s definition of high cost. In the 2009 data, due to the high incidence of error notations in the manufactured home loan data in 2009, medians are shown as “N/A“wherever error notations were present.For more information and analysis of the 2016 HMDA data, see the published article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2016/pdf/2015_HMDA.pdf.When performing aggregations and calculations on the HMDA data, medians were not calculated and percents were not computed where the count of loan events of that type or the denominator of the calculation was less than five. These places are identified on the map as having Insufficient Data. High-Cost Loans and PolicyMap‘s High-Cost Loan CalculationsPolicyMap classifies loans as high cost if they had a reported rate spread. In 2009, HMDA changed its rules for reporting rate spreads for the fourth quarter of the year in an effort to more accurately capture the current high-cost lending activity. In the first three quarters of 2009 and previous to 2009, the rate spread on a loan was the difference between the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on the loan and the treasury security yields as of the date of the loan‘s origination. Rate spreads were only reported by financial institutions if the APR was 3 or more percentage points higher for a first lien loan, or 5 or more percentage points higher for a second lien loan. A rate spread of 3 or more suggested that a loan was of notably higher price than a typical loan, indicating that it could be classified as high cost. The new rules introduced in the fourth quarter of 2009 indicate that the rate spread on a loan is the difference between the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on the loan and the estimated average prime offer rate (APOR). With the rule change, rate spreads are only reported by financial institutions if the APR is more than 1.5 percentage points higher for a first lien loan, or more than 3.5 percentage points higher for a second lien loan. A rate spread of 1.5 or more suggests that a loan is of notably higher price than a typical loan, indicating that it is to be classified as high cost.Likewise, all loans without reported rate spreads are considered to be prime, as the APR is within reasonable range of the treasury security yield (or, in the case of 2009Q4 and 2010 through 2016, within reasonable range of the estimated average prime offer rate). PolicyMap previously denoted high-cost loans as “subprime“Â, but changed the terminology with the release of the 2008 data to reflect language used by the Federal Reserve Bank. The “high-cost“designation is not to be confused with “HOEPA“Â. HOEPA loans are a subset of the high-cost loan category.“80-20“or “Piggyback“Loans and PolicyMap‘s Algorithm for “80-20“or “Piggyback“Loan EstimatesPolicyMap contains layer data on the number of loans originated for the purpose of a home purchase that had multiple mortgages. Termed “80-20 loans“or “piggyback loans“Â, a multiple mortgage transaction is when a buyer obtains at least two loans in order to purchase a home. The second loan finances that part of the purchase price not being financed by the first loan. The 80-20 or piggyback loan has been used to avoid underwriting standards held by most lenders that require private mortgage insurance (or PMI) when less than a 20% down payment is made by the buyer. Studies suggest that these transactions have a higher risk of default and foreclosure as the homebuyers have little or no equity at risk. HMDA data does not explicitly identify 80-20 or piggyback loans. PolicyMap created an algorithm for estimating transactions involving multiple loans to purchase a property. First- and second-position loans in the same census tract, from the same lender, and to applicants with the same race, ethnicity, gender, and income were flagged as multiple loans for the same property. These loans were then combined into one record, the loan amounts summed, thus reflecting the total loan for the property transaction. These loans were originated for the purchase of an owner-occupied, one-to-four family dwelling, as reported by HMDA.“Other“RacesPolicyMap contains data for specific race categories and for grouped race categories, such as those identified as “other“races. “Other“races is defined as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and individuals who either did not provide information or provided inapplicable information.Prime Loans and PolicyMap‘s Prime Loan CalculationsPrime loans are defined as loans with no reported rate spread. PolicyMap assumes for the purpose of its PolicyMap calculations that a loan without a reported rate spread is of a “typical“APR and most likely prime. The rate spread for 2004-2009Q3 on a loan was the difference between the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on the loan and the treasury security yields as of the date of the loan‘s origination. For that time period, rate spreads were only reported by financial institutions if the APR was 3 or more percentage points higher for a first lien loan, or 5 or more percentage points higher for a second lien loan, the rate spread for 2009Q4 and 2010 through 2016 is the difference between the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on the loan and the estimated average prime offer rate (APOR). In that same quarter, rate spreads are reported by financial institutions if the difference between the APR and the APOR is 1.5 or more percentage points for a first lien loan, or 3.5 or more percentage points higher for a second lien loan).",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-56744f50-5bba-4630-be19-8ed414d93210,Tabular Data,English,,Society|Mortgages,PolicyMap,2004|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2016,1.0,GeoBlacklight

Dale E. Jones, Sherri Doty, Clifford Grammich, James E. Horsch, Richard Houseal, Mac Lynn, John P. Marcum, Kenneth M. Sanchagrin and Richard H. Taylor supervised the collection. These data originally appeared in Religious Congregations & Membership in the United States, 2000: An Enumeration by Region, State and County Based on Data Reported by 149 Religious Bodies, published by the Glenmary Research Center. The 2000 data excludes most of the historically African-American denominations and some other major groups. In an effort to correct for this, in 2002 the ASARB released an adjusted rate of adherence to all denominations per 1,000 people. The adjusted rate is included on PolicyMap; because of this correction some counties will have rates in excess of 1000. For more on the corrections see Roger Finke and Christopher P. Scheitle‘s article Accounting for the Uncounted athttp://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/Accounting%20for%20the%20Uncounted.pdf.2010 data were also collected by ASARB and include statistics for 236 religious groups, including number of churches and adherents. In contrast to the 2000 study, researchers obtained mailing lists for the eight largest historically African-American denominations. In addition to including membership information gathered from this list, online church locators were identified and used to identify additional congregation locations. For each congregation located in this way, a membership of 100 was assigned. However, it is important to note that, while the figures for African-American denominations are more accurate than those imputed for the 2000 U.S. Religion Census, the figures are still significantly lower than those reported by the denominations in the Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, 2010. In total, the 236 groups reported 344,894 congregations with 150,686,156 adherents, comprising 48.8 percent of the total U.S. population in 2010.The data reported on Jews and Muslims are estimates rather than counts.

32b569f9-c5d3-46d6-a684-f03dd588e4c0,CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) Eligibility Criteria,"The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was enacted by Congress in 1977, is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking operations. CRA requires that each insured depository institution‘s record in helping meet the credit needs of its entire community be evaluated periodically. These examinations are conducted by federal agencies: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). That record is taken into account in considering an institution‘s application for deposit facilities, including mergers and acquisitions.In order to gauge CRA performance, the evaluation looks for bank activity in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, nonmetropolitan distressed and underserved areas, and federally designated disaster areas. These areas are identified by calculating tract income level. This is the Median Family Income (MFI) of each tract divided by Area Median Family Income (AMFI). Starting in 2012, the CRA changed its formula by calculating AMFI (now designated as “Metropolitan Median Family Income“Â) using Census‘2011-2015 American Community Survey estimates. For AMFI the CRA relies on HUD‘s 2004 MSA/MD MFI. For tracts located outside of an MSA/MD, the MFI used in the denominator is the statewide non-MSA/MD MFI. This figure is calculated using incomes from all areas of a state that are not assigned to MSA/MDs. For additional information on data and calculations see: http://www.ffiec.gov/geocode/help3.aspxThe tract income level is defined as follows:If the Median Family Income % is < 50% then the Income Level is Low. If the Median Family Income % is >= 50% and < 80% then the Income Level is Moderate.If the Median Family Income % is >= 80% and < 120% then the Income Level is Middle.If the Median Family Income % is >=120% then the Income Level is Upper.If the Median Family Income % is 0% then the Income Level is Not Known.Tracts are CRA eligible if they are low- or moderate-income, or if they are nonmetropolitan middle income tracts designated by FFIEC as distressed or underserved. Distressed middle income tracts are those with: (1) Unemployment rate at least 1.5 times the national average or (2) Poverty rate of 20% or greater or (3) Population loss of 10% or more between the 1990 and 2000 census, or a net migration loss of 5% or more between 1995 and 2000. Underserved middle-income tract are those designated by the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture with an “urban influence code“of 7, 10, 11 or 12. Lists of these tracts are released annually and available on the CRA website at: http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/examinations.htm. PolicyMap also provides the distressed and underserved designation for tracts that were designated as such in the previous year but not the current year because of the allowance of a one-year “lag period.“According to the source, “this lag period will be in effect for the 12 months immediately following the date when a census tract that was designated distressed or underserved is removed from the designation list. Revitalization or stabilization activities undertaken during the lag period will receive consideration as community development activities if they would have been considered to have a primary purpose of community development if the census tract in which they were located were still designated as distressed or underserved.“For more information, see page 24 of this Federal Register document: https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-25/pdf/2016-16693.pdfTo identify tracts that are “designated disaster areas“consult the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website: http://wwww.fema.gov.

8549f9f2-5bb6-4c2a-aa64-a36c7a054d1d,Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics‘Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program produces monthly and annual employment, unemployment, and labor force data for Census regions and divisions, States, counties, metropolitan areas, and many cities, by place of residence. PolicyMap contains county and state counts of people employed, unemployed, and in the labor force, as well as the unemployment rate. The annual values presented in PolicyMap are annual averages for the years listed as provided by the BLS.The concepts and definitions used by LAUS come from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the household survey that is the official measure of the labor force for the nation. According to this definition, employed persons include people who did any paid work as employees, worked in their own business or farm, or did unpaid work of 15 or more hours in an establishment owned by a relative. Unemployed persons include people who had no employment but were available for and seeking employment. People in the labor force are all those people classified as employed or unemployed. The labor force does not include military (active duty) and institutionalized persons.Every April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics re-releases revised data for the previous five years. PolicyMap‘s data reflects these revisions. In 2015, the BLS changed the methodology of their model, with changes relating to structural differences, real-time benchmarking, smoothed seasonal adjustment, and treatment of outliers. At the state-level data, this methodology was used to re-estimate all data back to 1976 (PolicyMap displays data for 2000 and later). At sub-state geographies (city, county, CBSA, metropolitan division), the new methodology was only used to re-estimate data going back to January 2010. For this reason, comparisons between data before and after this change are not advised. Certain sub-state areas have the revised methodology re-estimated back to 1990: New York City (back to 1976), the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale metropolitan division, the Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights, IL metropolitan division; the Cleveland-Elyria, OH metropolitan area; the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI metropolitan area; the Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall, FL metropolitan division; and the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, WA metropolitan division. Note that the previous methodology disaggregated data from the state level; because the state methodology is being re-estimated for before 2010, sub-state level data is indirectly affected.This data reflects recent county geography changes not yet implemented on PolicyMap: Bedford city (county equivalent) in Virginia was added to Bedford County; Petersburg Borough in Alaska was created out of parts of the former Petersburg Census Area and part of Hoonah-Angoon Census Area; and Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area in Alaska added a part of the former Petersburg Census Area. These removed counties still appear on the map, showing insufficient data. Data for counties with geography changes (such as Bedford County, Virginia) reflect the new geography which is not visible on PolicyMap.The annual data contains percent change calculations on the number of people in the labor force and employed, as well as a change in percent calculation of the unemployment rate.

415f3a14-3722-4d33-850b-9a6f1ae8a04c,Reinvestment Fund Market Value Analyses (MVAs),"Reinvestment Fund‘s Market Value Analyses (MVAs) are typologies of local real estate markets, designed to help governments and private investors target investment and prioritize action in ways that can leverage investment and revitalize neighborhoods.To develop this analysis, Reinvestment Fund uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis that helps to uncover patterns in data. Cluster analysis does this by forming groups of areas that are similar along a set of selected values that describe those areas. While the groups are formed to be as uniform as possible within, the groups are also as dissimilar as possible from one another. Using this technique, the MVA is able to reduce vast amounts of data on hundreds of thousands of properties and hundreds of areas down to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources. Reinvestment Fund uses many indicators in its analyses including various combinations of the following: average home sale price, percent change in average home sale price over time, percent owner occupancy, percent vacancy, percent vacant lots, percent of rental units that are Section 8, percent commercial, percent of properties with foreclosure, percent prime home purchase loans, number of new construction permits, number of Sheriff sales as a percent of owner occupied units, number of public housing units, percent of properties deemed dangerous, percent of structures demolished, percent of high risk or very high risk credit scores for predatory lending, and percent of housing units built before 1950.Working with the MVA client, Reinvestment Fund forms geographic study areas for the cluster analysis. Although many of these study areas are displayed using similar color schemes, they can not be compared. Please consult the description relevant to the study area for a full description of each MVA.FLORIDA Jacksonville, FL (2018)Reinvestment Fund‘s Market Value Analysis (MVA) describes the characteristics of the block groups within a study area. In 2018, Reinvestment Fund updated the Market Value Analysis in Jacksonville. The MVA indicators in Duval County are noted below and represent the dimensions upon which block groups are analyzed:Median Sales Price: Duval County Property Appraiser‘s file of all recorded sales between 1/1/2016 through 12/31/2017 for residential sales of $1,000 or more.Coefficient of Variation: The coefficient of variation, derived from the Duval County Property Appraiser‘s file of sales, represents the variability of sale prices within the block group. (High numbers represent places with wide variations in sale prices.)Foreclosure as a Percent of Sales: Foreclosure filings (Duval County Clerk of Court) were added to a Duval County file of bank-owned, registered vacant properties in 2018. This figure is then divided by the number of sales in 2016-2017 (from County Assessor‘s file).Percent Water Shut-off: JEA file of properties where water service has been shut off divided by the total number of residential properties. This is an indicator of vacancy.Percent >$5K Rehab: Duval County records of all building permits issued between 1/1/2016 through 12/31/2017 for new construction and substantial rehabilitation (estimated value greater than $5,000) of properties divided by the total number of residential parcels.Percent Homestead Exempt: Duval County Parcel File, total number of residential properties claiming a Homestead Exemption divided by the number of residential parcels.Percent Publicly Subsidized Rental: Represents Duval County and City of Jacksonville Housing Authority owned developments, and HUD-assisted rental housing developments including Housing Choice Vouchers (aggregated to the Census Block Group by the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, University of Florida), divided by the number of renter-occupied housing units (ACS 2016).",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,https://www.reinvestment.com/initiatives/market-value-analysis/,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-415f3a14-3722-4d33-850b-9a6f1ae8a04c,Tabular Data,English,Reinvestment Fund,Society|Market Value Analyses|Real Estate,PolicyMap,2018,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2018,1.0,GeoBlacklight

The LEHD program combines federal, state and Census Bureau data on employers and employees under the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership. Under the LED partnership, states share Unemployment Insurance earnings data and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data with the Census. Census combines these data with additional federal administrative data, Census data, and surveys. The LEHD program also creates a partially synthetic dataset on workers‘residential patterns, offering a dynamic link showing where people live and where they work.LED was built state by state, and a handful of state-year combinations are not available. These include Arizona (2002 and 2003), Arkansas (2002), the District of Columbia (2002-2009), Massachusetts (2002-2010), Mississippi (2002 and 2003), New Hampshire (2002), Wyoming (2014-2015), Puerto Rico (all years), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (all years). Data on the resident workforce is available for these locations for all years. However, the employment-based numbers are loaded as insufficient data. For more on the LED Partnership see: http://lehd.ces.census.gov/state_partners/.Federal employment is not counted in state Unemployment Insurance data, and as a result federal employment was not included in LEHD until 2010. Data shown by default on PolicyMap later than 2010 contain federal employment. However, additional variables in the legend allow users to see earlier data, without federal employment numbers. In order to calculate percent changes in employment and workforce numbers, PolicyMap subtracted federal employment from certain indicators (as noted) from 2010 onwards. Percent change numbers involving any year between 2002 and 2009 does not include federal jobs.Some demographic variables were introduced in 2009, including race, ethnicity, educational attainment, and sex. Because of the incomparability of the data between 2009 and 2010 with the introduction of Federal employment, PolicyMap chose to begin mapping these additional indicators in 2010.

Estimates are collected from public health facilities participating in the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). These data may disproportionately represent certain populations within a state; for instance, a severe flu outbreak in one city or region may cause the statewide activity level to be High, even if flu activity is low or minimal in other areas throughout the state. State health departments may have more geographically precise information available; contact information for these departments is available in FluView.Geographic spread of influenza is reported directly to CDC by state epidemiologists. This is a measure of how much of each state is affected by flu, and is not a measure of the severity of influenza activity. Weekly data and state and local surveillance information are available at the CDC Influenza Surveillance website.ILI activity and geographic spread measures are provided weekly. To obtain seasonal values, PolicyMap calculated the average of the numerical activity levels for all weeks ending in a given season. Flu season is defined as the period beginning in October and ending in March. For geographic spread, PolicyMap assigned a numerical scale where No Activity = 1 and Widespread = 5, in order to calculate the average spread for the year.

Nor is there a single source of data that indicates the demand for childcare services. Supply figures are often, at best, an estimate. And where demand data does exist, it is difficult to directly know which children are in childcare and which are not; which are in childcare near where their parents live or near where they work. Because of this, Reinvestment Fund statistically estimated both the supply of and demand for childcare by combining data from several different datasets to best approximate both sides of the supply/demand equation.The following data were used to approximate supply. The amount of information contained in each database varies considerably; they are listed in order below from the dataset with the most information to the least information:OCDEL database (June 2013 and updates quarterly) and Includes all 1,888 state licensed childcare centers in Philadelphia.

CDBG funds are allocated on a formula basis and grantees need to submit a Consolidated Plan showing that the activities funded will benefit in majority low and moderate income people.In order to be eligible for CDBG funds on an area basis, at least 51% of the activity‘s beneficiaries must be of low and moderate income. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines as low and moderate income all individuals living in a household with income below 80% of the area median family income. Through FY 2013, HUD published a summary of the number of people who are low and moderate income at the split block group level. During this time, HUD based its figures on the decennial Census. In FY 2014, HUD started basing its figures on the Census‘American Community Survey (2006-2010). Because ACS has a smaller sample and is less precise than the decennial Census, for FY 2014, HUD published a summary of the number of people who are low and moderate income at the block group, but not the split block group, level. For FY 2018, HUD based its figures on the 2011-2015 ACS.In addition, HUD publishes every year a list of “exception grantees,“which are areas with smaller overall concentrations of low and moderate income people.

The UCR Program is voluntary, and includes data for only counties and cities with population over 10,000. As a result, coverage is not universal. The UCR Program collects data on known offenses and persons arrested by law enforcement agencies. The UCR Program does not record the findings of a court, coroner, jury, or the decision of a prosecutor.As the FBI does not provide standard geographic identifiers, PolicyMap assigns the data to places and counties using the US Department of Justice‘s Law Enforcement Agency Identifier Crosswalk from 2005. The Crosswalk relates originating agency identifiers to Federal Information Processing Standards Codes (FIPS codes). PolicyMap uses the matched FIPS codes to display the data on the map.Data was reported to the FBI for selected places and counties by local law enforcement agencies. The FBI compiled the data and provided PolicyMap with those statistics that met FBI reporting standards. County counts reflect the sum of all reported offenses from agencies within the county that submitted data to the FBI. The county count may not include all offenses if agencies within the county did not report or if reported figures did not comply with FBI reporting standards. Those places or counties either not reporting to the FBI or not complying with FBI reporting standards and, thus, not compiled by the FBI, are shown as having Insufficient Data in the map. Certain counties, such as those in New York City, are not shown on PolicyMap because the FBI reported no population in those counties. Data for agencies in these counties was reported by the FBI, but not included in the FBI‘s county aggregation. Values for places were obtained by matching each agency with the place it is in based on the Crosswalk. Where multiple agencies reported data in one place, the values were aggregated by PolicyMap.The FBI cautions against using UCR data to rank municipalities, as many factors contribute to the number of crimes that occur and are reported. More information can be found here: https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use.

e30bfdcc-bbd5-464b-99a0-8d7ed363cec5,PolicyMap & Zillow,"PolicyMap developed its Home Sales indicators using the proprietary Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX), provided by Zillow, a leading real estate and rental marketplace. To create the ZTRAX database, Zillow collects county sale transaction records from a third-party provider, which it supplements with data it receives directly from counties.PolicyMap calculates median home sale price, sales volume, percent change in the median sale price, and percent change in sales volume for current and historic time periods at the summary levels of block group, tract, county, place, and state.PolicyMap‘s Home Sales indicators are distinct from the Home Listing and Sales data available through Zillow Research. PolicyMap developed a methodology that employs a unique filtering process to calculate each indicator. Using this methodology, PolicyMap creates indicators at small census geographies that are not available directly from Zillow. PolicyMap also calculates home sales for distinct housing type categories. PolicyMap includes counts and median sale prices of recent home sales for 2005 through 2017 for annual and quarterly values and additional quarterly values for 2018. Percent changes in median sale prices and counts are available for one-, three-, and five-year intervals, as well as one and four quarter increments. Updated quarterly data will be added to PolicyMap on a biannual basis. Due to the elapsed time between property sale transactions quarterly data will generally lag two to four quarters behind the current date.PolicyMap created four housing type categories: all residential sales, single family, two to four unit multifamily, and condominium and cooperative housing. Single family homes typically include single-family residences, townhouses/rowhouses, rural residences, bungalows, and modular housing. Two to four unit multifamily homes include duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes, which are all eligible for residential home mortgage loans. Condominium and cooperative homes typically include single-unit sales for condominiums, cluster homes, zero-lot-line homes, patio homes, garden homes, landominiums, and other forms of cooperative housing. The indicators for all residential sales include all three of the above categories since they are all considered non-commercial, residential home sales. Multifamily buildings with five or more units and apartment building sales were removed from all transactions since they are considered commercial sales.To ensure that only market based residential transactions were included, PolicyMap uses the subset of residential sales that were at-arm‘s-length transactions, over $5,000 in value, and did not involve vacant or unimproved land. Transactions that involved auctions, foreclosures, Real Estate Owned (REO) property sales, sheriff sales, or Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are also excluded. Partial sales, property improvements, and transfers across multiple properties (also called bulk sales) are likewise removed. PolicyMap suppresses indicators with fewer than five sales in a given time period and geography as “insufficient data.“ÂPercent change calculations are based on the median sale price at Time 1 and the median sale price at Time 2 for geographies and time frames that are not suppressed due to insufficient data. Change calculations are not adjusted for inflation.

The website and the data PolicyMap obtained from PA DCED as of May 9, 2012 contain information on projects that are either underway or have been completed across the state of Pennsylvania, as well as the number of jobs created and the amount of money invested in these projects.There are a number of circumstances in which double counting occurs in the data. If a project crosses either county or Congressional District boundaries, both counties or Districts take credit for the entire investment amount and the number jobs created by the project. Projects indicated as “statewide“also include the entire investment amount and the number of jobs created by the project. For example, if a given project is indicated in the Investment Tracker data as being a part of Montgomery County, Philadelphia County, and Statewide, the two counties and the state are each allocated the entire amount and the total number of jobs. Also, if a project is funded by more than one program, all programs listed claim the entire number of jobs created by the project. For example, if the Ashley Furniture Industries project, which is funded by the OppGrant program and the JCTC program, creates 720 jobs, both the OppGrant program and the JCTC program will each claim they created 720 jobs. Projects that occur at the county level are projects that took place specifically within that county. For example, if a project is listed as taking place in Bucks County, the project will count towards the county total. Likewise, if a project is listed as taking place in Philadelphia, Montgomery, and Bucks County, the project will be counted towards the county totals for all three counties.Statewide or Multi-County projects are those that occur at the state level. These are projects specifically listed as “statewide,““state projects,“or projects that occur in “all“counties. These projects occur on a state level and are not counted towards the county totals in addition to the statewide totals. As such, statewide totals are typically smaller than the individual county totals. Statewide totals only take into account projects that take place on a statewide level, and do not represent a cumulative sum of the total investments made across all counties.The PA DCED also has information regarding programs and projects that occur on a regional level.

These data are available for states and counties. These data represent the place of residence at earliest HIV diagnosis; duplicate records from different states are reconciled by the source. Some states without confidential name-based HIV infection reporting have elected not to release state and/or county-level data.CDC provides estimates on new HIV diagnoses for a given year. HIV data for a given year presented on PolicyMap represent the number of confirmed diagnoses of HIV infection or infection classified as stage 3 (AIDS) confirmed by laboratory analysis as of December 31 of that year and reported to the CDC by June 30 of the following year. These data may not be limited to new infections (i.e., incidence); rather, these data represent new diagnoses, as the date of infection may vary by individual. Estimates are statistically-adjusted values based upon actual case counts reported to CDC by state and local health departments. The CDC suppressed values in areas with fewer than 5 reported cases and/or population less than 100 as well as in the county with the lowest population in states where only one other county‘s data were suppressed.Data on the number of new cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis reported each year, and the rate of new STD cases reported for every 100,000 residents, by state and county are available from CDC. Data are based on cases of STDs reported to state and local health departments. Data is reported by both public and private agencies, such as STD clinics, counselingesting sites, drug treatment clinics, family planning clinics, and private physicians. The CDC collects data from regional jurisdictions, and publishes the data in an annual report, which can be downloaded here: https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/default.htm.Syphilis is presented as a combined sum of cases classified in either primary or secondary stages of the disease. Other categories of syphilis and not included in the data and are latent (without symptoms), tertiary (late stage), and congenital (transferred from mother to child). Primary and secondary forms of the disease are the most infectious and therefore important when considering the risk of transfer and spread of disease. Some variability in the amount of in the amount of reporting may exist across the country. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are considered Nationally Notifiable, which means that regional jurisdictions provide information to the CDC on a voluntary basis. A nationally notifiable disease is not necessarily reportable by law within a given state. Because of incomplete diagnosis and reporting, the number of STD cases reported is less than the actual number of cases occurring. The level of consistency may vary between local jurisdictions, reporting agencies, and reporting years. In some areas, reporting from public sources is thought to be more complete than reporting from private sources.Incidence rates were calculated by the CDC using total population as the denominator.

The dataset was created in collaboration with organizations representing consumers, doctors, hospitals, employers, accrediting organizations, and other federal agencies, as part of an overall effort to improve patient safety and care.The Hospital Compare dataset on PolicyMap includes data on:General information (Overall Rating, Mortality, Safety of Care, Readmission, Patient Experience, Effectiveness of Care, Timeliness of Care, Effective use of Medical Imaging): The overall hospital rating is given in stars from 1 to 5, while all other measures are designated as either being below, same, or above the national average. Data for these measures is compiled through the Inpatient/Outpatient Quality Reports and other programs mandatory for Medicare-certified hospitals. All comparisons on national average were standardized to ensure a common scale and direction for each measure. This implies that hospitals that perform above average on mortality or readmission comparison have a higher standardized z-score on these measures, based on lower mortality and readmission rates than the national average. The overall star rating in this section is intended primarily for acute care hospitals, due to which CMS may have omitted the measure for specialty hospitals. More details on the methodology for calculating overall ratings can be found here. Structural Measures (Presence of facilities which include ability to receive lab results electronically, ability to track lab results, tests, and referrals electronically, presence of various registries): These measures are designated a Yes or No classification depending on whether a given facility is available at a hospital. Data for these measures is submitted by hospital and their vendors through an online data entry tool.Survey of patients‘experiences and (Ratings on Care transition, Cleanliness, Communication, Pain Management, Staff Responsiveness, Quietness, Discharge Information, and overall hospital ratings): All of these measures are assigned a star rating from 1 to 5. Data for these measures is compiled using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey [HCAHPS], which is administered to a random sample of adult inpatients after discharge. In order to receive HCAHPS Star Ratings, hospitals must have at least 100 completed HCAHPS surveys over a given four-quarter period. While all of the star ratings are based on direct patient responses, the summary star rating is calculated as a weighted measure using all categories of patient responses, including overall patient rating. More details on the methodology for calculating HCAHPS star ratings can be found here.Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI): HAI measures show how often patients in a particular hospital contract certain infections during the course of their medical treatment, when compared to like hospitals. These infections can often be prevented when healthcare facilities follow guidelines for safe care. Hospitals currently submit information on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), colon and abdominal hysterectomy surgical site infections (SSIs), MRSA Bacteremia, and C.difficile laboratory-identified events. More details on the methodology for calculating HCAHPS star ratings can be found here.Reasons for exclusion of certain measures for a hospital may include when number of cases/patients is too few to report, results are based on a shorter time period than required, data suppressed by CMS for one or more quarters, results are not available for this reporting period, there were discrepancies in the data collection process, this result is not based on performance data; the hospital did not submit data and did not submit a waiver, data are shown only for hospitals that participate in the Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) and Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) programs.More details on data collection and computation methodology for each dataset can be found here.This dataset is available on PolicyMap as point data based on hospital location, and can be viewed upon clicking each respective point.

For this index, PolicyMap used a total of 8 non-overlapping racial and ethnic categories provided by the US Census Bureau. These categories included the ethnic category Hispanic and the following 7 Non-Hispanic racial categories: White, African American, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, some other race, and two or more races.Theil‘s H is an index ranging from 0 to 1 that estimates the extent to which racial and ethnic groups are evenly distributed in a sub-area as compared to a larger area. Values approaching 0 suggest that sub-areas have a composition similar to the larger area (i.e., even distribution, less segregation) and values approaching 1 suggest that the racial and ethnic composition of sub-areas within a larger area deviates from the larger area (i.e., non-uniform distribution, more segregation). On PolicyMap, sub-areas are defined at the level of the Census block and are compared to the following larger areas: block groups, tracts, counties and Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), which are an approximation of metropolitan areas. The calculation of Theil‘s H is based on the methodology presented in the report, “The Multigroup Entropy Index“by John Iceland (2004).

County-level data for Alaska is not included because Alaska does not report its election results by county. Turnout data is only available for presidential elections, as midterm elections in different states do not have a standard top-of-the-ballot race by which turnout is calculated.Margin of victory maps provide a handy guide to see who won a given geography, and by how much. Values are calculated by subtracting the number of votes for the runner-up candidate from the number of votes for the winning candidate, and dividing that number by the total number of votes cast. Ranges, and not specific numbers, are available for each area.“Change in percent“calculations were calculated by subtracting the 2004 presidential candidate‘s vote percentage from the 2008 candidate‘s vote percentage. For example, if John Kerry won 45% of a county in 2004, and Barack Obama won 55% of that county in 2008, the change in percent would be 10%. Note that for House of Representative elections, this is calculated every two years. When elections are uncontested (ie., a candidate from one party runs, and no other candidates from another party run), we label the non-contesting parties as having received zero percent of the vote, even though they did not appear on the ballot. In some congressional districts where a candidate ran unopposed, no vote total was tallied by election officials; we label candidates in these districts as having “Insufficient data“for vote counts, and the winner as having 100 percent of the vote for the percent and change-in-percent calculations. The Congressional district boundaries changed in 2012 due to redistricting. Some states gained districts and some states lost districts, and within each state, the shapes of most districts changed. For this reason, change-in-percent calculations are not possible from the 2010 Congressional election to the 2012 election.

For both data layers, PolicyMap used a total of 8 non-overlapping racial and ethnic categories provided by the US Census Bureau. These included the ethnic category Hispanic and the following 7 Non-Hispanic racial categories: White, African American, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, some other race, and two or more races. The diversity index reflects the probability that any two people chosen at random from a given study area (e.g., block group) are of different races or ethnicities. An index value of 0 indicates complete homogeneity (i.e., an area‘s entire population belonging to one racial or ethnic group), while the maximum index value represents complete heterogeneity (i.e., each racial or ethnic group constituting an equal proportion of an area‘s population). The maximum value is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the number of racial or ethnic groups. For example, with 3 racial or ethnic groups, the index value reflecting complete diversity would be 1-(1/3) or 67%. Articulated further, with 3 racial groups of equal proportions (i.e., complete diversity), the index equation becomes 1 and (0.33^2 + 0.33^2 + 0.33^2) = 67%. Given 8 racial or ethnic categories, the maximum value of the index displayed on PolicyMap is 87.5%.With the diversity index data layer, lower index values between 0 and 20 suggest more homogeneity and higher index values above 50 suggest more heterogeneity. Racial and ethnic diversity can be indicative of economic and behavioral patterns. For example, racially and ethnically homogenous areas are sometimes representative of concentrated poverty or concentrated wealth. They could also be indicative of discriminatory housing policies or other related barriers.The predominant racial or ethnic group is calculated as the racial or ethnic group constituting the highest proportion of the population in a given geography.

7d338b1e-0829-43ea-b452-33afd8638cee,Census Geography Division,"Every ten years, following the Decennial Census, there are major updates to many of the Census boundaries based on a new population count. Additionally, there are minor updates annually reflecting changes to local geographies (for example, in 2014, the county-equivalent Bedford City, Virginia, was combined with its adjacent county). These minor updates also reflect more accurate surveying techniques by the Census.Because of the significant changes that were made to underlying geography files in 2010, PolicyMap displays different data at Census 2000 and 2010 boundaries. In some cases a single dataset will display some years of data at the 2000 vintage and other years at the 2010 vintage. For example, Census 2000 data is shown at the 2000 Census boundaries while the most recent American Community Survey (ACS) data is displayed at the 2010 boundaries.In cases where a single dataset relies on multiple boundary files, percent changes are calculated using relationship files and other materials provided by the Census. For more, see: http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/relationship. In most cases the materials provided by the Census were adequate to make the calculations. However, the process for calculating Block Group percent changes was more complex because the Census does not provide Block Group relationship files. PolicyMap relied on the Census Block relationship files for these calculations using a family, household, or population multiplier to crosswalk the 2000 data to 2010 boundaries to make the calculation. Percent changes that involve both 2000 and 2010 vintages are all displayed using 2010 Census boundary files. For additional information on percent change calculations please see data directory entries for individual datasets.PolicyMap has the following geographies with distinct boundaries for the 2000 vintage and 2010 vintage: block group, tract, county, county subdivision, and place. The state boundaries do not have substantial changes from 2000 to 2010 (changes are simply related to improved surveying), so only the latest 2010 state file is loaded in PolicyMap.Core-based Statistical Area (CBSA) and Metropolitan Division boundary files have been released on a different schedule than the other boundaries, as they are delineated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Significant changes were made in 2003 and 2013. PolicyMap uses 2010 CBSAs (which are based on the 2003 OMB delineation) and 2013 CBSAs. CBSA encompasses both metropolitan and micropolitan areas. For additional information on metro areas and their historical and current delineations please see: http://www.census.gov/population/metro/.Places (identified as “Cities“on PolicyMap) are defined by the Census as either incorporated places or Census Designated Places (CDPs). Incorporated places are legally established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people. An incorporated place is usually a city, town, village, or borough, but can take other forms. CDPs are statistical entities created by the Census “to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located“Â. For more on the difference between incorporated areas and CDPs, see: https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_place.html The vintages of Place boundaries used in PolicyMap are 2009 and 2010. The 2009 cities are labeled on PolicyMap as 2000 for the sake of consistency and ease of use, because they are used for Census 2000 data.Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are based on US Postal Service ZIP Codes, but they are not identical, and in many cases, may be significantly different. Though ZIP Codes change continuously, ZCTAs are set in 2010, and remain unchanged throughout the decade.The vintage and or year and of the boundary used can be found in several places throughout the site. On the Maps page, the boundary type and boundary year is shown in the legend once data is loaded on the map.

The NCCS Core 2015 PC File combines descriptive information from the IRS Business Master File (BMF) and financial variables from the IRS Return Transaction Files (RTF). The BMF is a cumulative file containing descriptive information on all active tax-exempt organizations. Data contained on the BMF are mostly derived from IRS Forms 1023 and 1024. The RTF are a source of all financial data for all organizations that file IRS Forms 990, Form 990-EZ, or Form 990-PF. Organizations not required to file Form 990, including religious organizations and those with less than $25,000 in gross receipts, are generally excluded from the file. NCCS also excludes a small number of other organizations, such as foreign organizations or those that are generally considered part of government.To create the Core file, NCCS first verifies and corrects, if needed, the financial data in the RTF using the Statistics of Income-coded return, and it manually reviews organizations‘990s on GuideStar when necessary. Next, NCCS matches records from the BMF to records in the RTF. Finally, NCCS enhances the data by adding the following fields available in PolicyMap: classification for each organization using the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (labeled “NTEE Major Group“in PolicyMap), and total revenue (labeled as such in PolicyMap).Other NCCS variables in PolicyMap include the following: EIN, or Employer Identification Number; Fiscal Year, or fiscal year defined by organization during which filing occurred; and Ruling Date, or year of IRS ruling or determination letter recognizing an organization‘s exempt status. Reason for 501(c)(3) Status reflects an organization‘s type at the time it obtained recognition of its exempt status from the IRS. Public Charity or Private Foundation indicates whether an organization is (1) a public charity, which is a 501(c)(3) organization that receives significant public support or falls into another category that entitles them to automatic public charity status, or (2) a private foundation, which is an organization created to distribute money to public charities or individuals, required to distribute at least five percent of their assets each year.

25919656-6c73-4137-898e-62c5372cf911,"National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data","The Common Core of Data (CCD) is a program of the U.S. Department of Education‘s National Center for Education Statistics that collects selected data about all public schools, public school districts and state education agencies in the United States every year. Data are supplied by state education agency officials.Some records have no student counts. This is because some schools contract with other schools or agencies to provide services for some students. Those student counts are not reported for the receiving school in order to avoid duplication. However, where all services are provided by a contracting school, no student counts are reported for the sending school.Certain indicators provided in this data on PolicyMap do not come from the NCES. Studenteacher ratio was calculated by PolicyMap by dividing the total number of students by the number of full-time-equivalent classroom teachers. The percentages of students of a given race were calculated by PolicyMap. The links to the GreatSchools school pages were made using a table from GreatSchools. Three indicators are included for consideration in matters related to the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI). These indicators label a school as being all-female, majority-minority, or in an inner city. All-female schools were calculated by summing the number of female students in each race category (the NCES does not provide total numbers of students by sex). If that number is equal to the number of students in the school, it is label as all female. This simply means that all the students in the school in the given school year were female; it does not mean that the school is by policy an all-female school.Majority-minority was calculated by dividing the number of white students by the number of total students. If the percent of students who are white is less than 50%, the school is labeled majority minority.The inner city label was not calculated using NCES data. A spatial calculation was made using ACS data, using methodology similar to that developed by the Initiative for a Competitive City (see http://www.icic.org/research-and-analysis/research-definitions). Using this methodology, a census tract in a metropolitan statistical area is considered to be part of an inner city if its poverty rate is 20% or higher, or it meets at least two of the three following criteria:Poverty rate 1.5 times or more than that of the MSAMedian household income .5 or less than that of the MSAUnemployment rate (using ACS) of 1.5 times or more than that of the MSASchools without coordinates are excluded from the data.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-25919656-6c73-4137-898e-62c5372cf911,Tabular Data,English,Common Core of Data|National Center for Educational Statistics|provided by the U.S. Department of Education,Society|Education,PolicyMap,2015|2016,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2016,1.0,GeoBlacklight

eb3f3e22-3c3d-4197-b50f-5bf10185a54e,Reinvestment Fund 2018 Limited Supermarket Access (LSA) Analysis,"Reinvestment Fund‘s Limited Supermarket Access (LSA) analysis is a tool to identify areas across the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia that have both inadequate and inequitable access to healthy food and sufficient market demand for new or expanded food retail operations. Click here to read an overview of the analysis. Using the LSA data on PolicyMap, a diverse range of clients“â€including policymakers, government agencies, lending institutions, community organizations, and researchers“â€can investigate LSA Areas within their geographies of interest and craft strategies based on the conditions specific to those communities.Identifying LSA AreasThe LSA analysis measures access to healthy food by identifying areas that are well-served by supermarkets and those that have relatively limited access to supermarkets. Reinvestment Fund uses supermarkets (grocery stores with at least $2 million in annual sales) as a proxy for healthy food access because a review of the relevant research shows that supermarkets, compared to smaller stores (e.g., corner stores), most consistently offer the greatest variety of healthy foods at the lowest prices. Supermarket location data comes from the 2017 Nielsen TDLinx database. Supermarkets include the following store types from that database: supermarkets, supercenters, limited assortment stores, and natural food stores. Superettes and dollar stores are excluded because they are less likely to offer a wide range of healthy foods. Wholesale clubs are excluded because they require a paid membership. Military commissaries are excluded because they are not open to the public. Other data sources include the 2010 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey for population, residential land area, households, household incomes, and car ownership rates and the 2016 Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey for spending on food for consumption at home.Access means different things in different places. In densely-populated urban areas, supermarkets tend to be located more closely together, and a neighborhood may have relatively limited access if its nearest store is a mile or two away. In rural areas, many if not most communities are miles from the nearest supermarket. To account for this variation, Reinvestment Fund assigns every census block group in the nation to one of seven classes based on that block group‘s population density and, for densely populated block groups, car ownership.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,https://www.reinvestment.com/research-publications/2018-update-analysis-of-limited-supermarket-access,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-eb3f3e22-3c3d-4197-b50f-5bf10185a54e,Tabular Data,English,Reinvestment Fund,Society|Food Access|Food Security,PolicyMap,2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2016,1.0,GeoBlacklight

3f0db547-e3be-4971-bce7-2f187df23f6c,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics,"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) dataset provides the number of infant deaths, and the rate of deaths to infants for every 1000 live births by maternal residents of the US. The CDC only reports numbers of births for counties with populations of 100,000 or more and number and rate of infant deaths for counties with populations of 250,000 or more. It suppresses the rate where there are fewer than 20 deaths reported.Adult mortality data are taken from the National Center for Health Statistics‘Compressed Mortality file as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. The Compressed mortality file provides the number and rate of deaths, by age group and cause of death as reported through the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10).Data on PolicyMap represent deaths from cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory disease among all age groups, from 2000 through 2015; and deaths from homicide, suicide, motor vehicle traffic, and accidental injury. These causes have topped the CDC‘s list of leading causes of death since 2005. Underlying cause-of-death is indicated on the death certificate by the physician. The National Center for Health Statistics determines one cause of death when more than one cause or condition is entered by the physician.Adults ages 35 and older are used as a base category for deaths from disease because these age groups represent most of the deaths from the four leading causes. Rates are calculated per 100,000 population 35 and over in the source data using population estimates based on 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census counts.The CDC‘s National Center for Health Statistics released an estimated model of drug overdose data in its Data Visualization Gallery. The CDC provides only ranges of rates rather than specific rates for each county. Because data is not available from many counties, the data are smoothed across geographies using Bayesian hierarchical modeling to “borrow strength“across geographic areas. This method allows estimates to be generated for counties that have small populations. The CDC adds a disclaimer to this dataset that in certain states and years, for example New Jersey (2009) and West Virginia (2005, 2009), the rates may be lower than expected due to a large number of unresolved cases or misclassification of ICD-10 codes. More information on the CDC‘s methodology is available here.Opioid and narcotic poisoning data comes from the CDC‘s Multiple Cause of Death files. Drug overdose deaths were classified using the Tenth Revision (ICD-10) of the International Classification of Disease underlying-cause-of-death codes for drug poisonings (overdose): X40-44 (unintentional), X60-64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10andY14 (undetermined intent).The types of opioid involved in drug overdose deaths were classified following the ICD-10 codes: and T40.1 (heroin), T40.2 (natural and semisynthetic opioids), T40.3 (methadone), and T40.4 (synthetic opioids, other than methadone).

Then, for each block group, EPA identified transit routes with service that stops within 0.4 km (0.25 miles). Finally, EPA summed aggregate service frequency by block group. Values for this metric are expressed as service frequency per hour of service. GTFS is a transit data reporting standard that allows public transit agencies to publish data in a standard format. EPA also calculated frequency of transit service per square mile by dividing frequency of transit service per hour by total land acreage then converting to units per square mile. Where the total land acreage was zero, total block group acreage was used as the denominator.To create the indicators on job or workforce accessibility by auto travel, the EPA joined an origin-destination matrix to employment and demographic data from the 2010 Census.

c55867a4-3975-4965-87d4-5e14ce1d6e0b,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI),"Social vulnerability refers to populations that are particularly vulnerable to disruption and health problems as a result of natural disasters, human-made disasters, climate change, and extreme weather. The Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (GRASP) within the CDC created the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to help flag areas where residents will be in greatest need of support and recovery assistance in the case of a disaster or extreme weather event.The index is comprised of four categories of vulnerability“â€socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing and transportation. Data from the 2012-2016 ACS informs the score for each category. Socioeconomic vulnerability is comprised of population below poverty, unemployed population, low income population, and people with no high school diploma. Vulnerability due to household composition and disability is comprised of adults age 65 or older, children age 17 or younger, people over age 5 with a disability, and single parent households. The minority status and language category is comprised of minority population, defined as people of any race or ethnicity other than non-Hispanic White, and people over the age of five who speak English less than well. The housing and transportation category is a combination of housing units in multifamily buildings with ten or more units, mobile homes, crowded housing units (defined as housing units with more people than rooms), households with no available vehicle, and group quarters population (which includes dormitories, prisons, and people living in other institutions).The GRASP program combined the ACS variables into categories by assigning each geography a percentile ranking for that variable, then summing those percentiles to create an overall score within that category. Then percentile rankings were assigned for each of the four categories, which were summed to create the overall Social Vulnerability Index. The four social vulnerability levels“â€Low, Low to Moderate, Moderate to High, and High“â€are defined by dividing all tracts or counties in the country into quantiles based on the Social Vulnerability Index.

Structurally deficient bridges are characterized by deteriorating conditions and reduced load-carrying capacity. Although this classification does not imply that a bridge is unsafe, these structures typically require significant maintenance and repair to remain in service and eventually may need major rehabilitation or to be fully replaced. Functionally obsolete bridges do not meet current design standards either due to increased traffic volumes or revised engineering design standards.The source of the data is the National Bridge Inventory (NBI), a database of more than 600,000 bridges located on public roads. This data was compiled in 2018 by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and collected from individual state departments of transportation.

As with the standard FHFA HPIs, revisions to these indexes may reflect the impact of new data or technical adjustments. Indexes are calibrated using appraisal values and sales prices for mortgages bought or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. An index is not reported in cases where sample sizes on mortgage transactions are too small for a given geographic area.

PolicyMap includes AMI at a variety of percentages for a variety of household sizes. The 30%, 50% (Very Low Income), and 80% (Low Income) of median income by family size as well as the overall area median income are provided by HUD. PolicyMap calculated 60% of Area Median Income by multiplying the 50% threshold by 1.2 and calculated 120% of AMI by multiplying the 50% threshold by 2.4, per instructions in the LIHTC legislation, on HUD‘s website, and in communications between PolicyMap and the HUD User electronic help desk resource. The income thresholds as they are calculated in PolicyMap may not be appropriate for your needs if your programs or requirements specify a different method for determining income thresholds.

No-Stat addresses include Rural Route addresses vacant for 90 days or longer, addresses for businesses or homes under construction and not yet occupied, and addresses in urban areas identified by a carrier as not likely to be active for some time.

However, the total vacant, total percent vacant, the total No-Stat and total percent No-Stat include the sum of all three categories: business, residential and other.A few notes of caution with respect to percent change variables: In March 2010 the US Postal Service implemented new procedures to improve the accuracy of its vacancy indicators. This led to a large increase nationally, with much more drastic fluctuations in some local areas. Comparisons across time periods spanning the first and second quarters of 2010 may be problematic. For 2007 and 2008 the USPS geocoding methodology and some of the USPS business practices produced anomalies, which may result in spikes in the total address count in a tract that can not necessarily be attributed as growth since the previous year. Also, zip code splitting, may result in similar spikes or drops in total addresses that can not necessarily be attributed to growth or decline.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://www.huduser.org/DATASETS/usps,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-14fd5364-0c4d-49e6-9035-6ecd058f8b7b,Tabular Data,English,Dept.

The UCR Program is voluntary, and includes data for only counties and cities with population over 10,000. As a result, coverage is not universal. The UCR Program collects data on known offenses and persons arrested by law enforcement agencies. The UCR Program does not record the findings of a court, coroner, jury, or the decision of a prosecutor.The Hate Crime Statistics Program within the FBI‘s (UCR) Program collects data regarding criminal offenses that were motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender‘s bias against a race, ethnicity, ancestry, gender, gender identity, religion, disability or sexual orientation and were committed against persons, property, or society. Hate crime data is captured by including the element of bias in offenses already being reported to the UCR Program. State hate crime counts reflect the sum of all reported offenses from agencies within the state that submitted data to the FBI. The state population count used in the rate calculations is an estimate of the number of people served by the agencies within the state that report offenses. In 2015, a total of 14,997 law enforcement agencies participated in the Hate Crime Statistics Program, and, of those, a total of 1,742 agencies reported hate crime occurring within their jurisdiction. The State of Hawaii does not participate in the Hate Crime Statistics Program. Due to variation in reporting and hate crime definitions changing over time, FBI hate crime statistics should not be compared across states, and should not be compared from one year to another.

For this project, NCHS calculated abridged life tables at the Census tract level. An “abridged life table“is a series of estimates of life expectancy for people of different ages grouped into multi-year cohorts.To create these abridged life tables, NCHS worked with the National Vital Statistics System to geocode residences recorded on death certificates from 2010 to 2015 (inclusive). The Department of Housing and Urban Development Geocode Center performed the geocoding. Maine and Wisconsin are excluded from this study because they did not have geocoded death certificates for 2010. The life table calculations also required Census tract level population estimates. NCHS worked with the Census Bureau to create a set of custom 6-year population estimates for the years 2010and2015 using data from the 2010 Census and the 2011and2015 ACS for use in this project.The NCHS used information on the location of residence and age of the deceased combined with the population estimates to build age patterns or “schedules of mortality“for 4,639 “model tracts.“Model tracts met two criteria“â€each had a population over 5,000 and one or more recorded deaths in each age group during the 6-year window.Using schedules of mortality from the model tracts, the NCHS developed statistical models to predict death rates based on demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic variables. They used these models to fill in data for tracts with smaller populations, and for tracts with age groups that had “missing deaths“or no recorded deaths within an age group. For the model tracts, reported values for all age ranges are calculated directly from the death certificates and population estimates. For the tracts with some missing deaths, values predicted by the statistical models are used for the age groups that had no recorded deaths, and observed values are used for all other age ranges. For some tracts with low populations, all values are based on predictions from the statistical models.

Rental Affordability calculations assume that a family can afford to spend 30% or less of their income on rent, which corresponds to the threshold for housing cost burden as defined by the Census Bureau. This translates to 1/36th of the family‘s annual income each month. For example, a family of four with an income of $30,000 could afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment for $750 or less per month. Home Ownership Affordability estimates assume that a family can afford to purchase a home valued at three times their annual salary. This means that a family of four with an income of $30,000 could afford to purchase a home valued at less than $90,000. These estimates can be used to compare the relative affordability of the housing stock in different areas, or to determine whether the existing housing stock in an area is sufficient to meet the needs of low- or middle-income residents.The 2013-2017 calculations rely on HUD‘s FY2019 Area Median Income (AMI) data. The 30%, 50% (Very Low Income), and 80% (Low Income) of median income by family size as well as the overall area median income are provided by HUD.

Twenty seven chronic disease measures were estimated at the level of census tracts, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‘s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and the American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. The chronic disease measures were selected to help implement targeted prevention programs, identify emerging health problems, and establish and monitor health objectives.The 500 cities included the top 497 largest American cities and the largest cities in Vermont (Burlington), West Virginia (Charleston), and Wyoming (Cheyenne). The range of city population spans 42,400 in Burlington, VT to 8,175,100 in New York, NY. The study includes a total population of approximately 103,020,800, which represents 33.4% of the United States population. A total of approximately 28,000 census tracts are included for all 500 cities.Because the small area estimation model cannot capture the direct effects of local programs and initiatives, caution should be taken not to use the data to evaluate the outcome of such programs. Small area estimation models are statistical techniques used to estimate the values of indicators for sub-populations from larger surveys that include those sub-populations. The overall survey used for the small area estimation model is the CDC‘s annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. Because some questions in the BRFSS survey rotate yearly, not every 500 Cities indicator is available for every year. The 500 Cities estimation approach allows for the estimation at multiple geographic levels, and accounts for the relationships between individual characteristics, individual health outcomes, and spatial contexts and other factors.

This survey is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau as a special supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The FDIC undertook this effort to address a gap in the availability of comprehensive data on the number of unbanked and underbanked households in the United States.These estimates are based on data aggregated from the 2013, 2015, and 2017 surveys, pulled from the multi-year microdata published by the FDIC at https://www.economicinclusion.gov/downloads/. Like with all estimates derived from survey data, the values published in these data layers are associated with some uncertainty. In order to help users understand the reliability of the estimates, PolicyMap published margins of error at the 90% confidence level associated with each estimate. This means that there is a 90% likelihood that if every household in the given geography was interviewed, the count or percent would be within the margin of error above or below the estimate derived from the survey sample. For example, 4.8% of households in Colorado were unbanked, with a margin of error of 1.3%. This may be expressed as 4.8% Ã‚Â± 1.3%, which means that there is a 90% likelihood that the true percentage of unbanked households in Colorado was between 3.5% and 6.1% (expressing the margin of error in this way is known as a “confidence interval.“PolicyMap has also published a data flag to help users interpret these margins of error. The data flags are based on “coefficients of variation,“which are the ratios between the standard error and the margin of error.

In the case of the Department of Education grants and loans, these are aggregated to the place rather than the county geography.

The CDFI Fund considers a tract to be an Area of Economic Distress if it meets at least one of the following criteria: (i) At least 20% of Very-Low Income households spend more than half of their income on housing; or (ii) Unemployment rate is greater than 1.5 times the national average; or (iii) The tract is a Low-Income Housing Tax Credit qualified census tract; or (iv) Greater than 20 percent of households have incomes below the poverty rate with a rental vacancy rate of at least 10 percent; or (v) Greater than 20 percent of households have incomes below the poverty rate with a homeownership vacancy rate of at least 10 percent; or (vi) Tract is an underserved rural area as defined in the CMF Interim Rule.FHFA‘s Duty to Serve regulation defines “rural area“as: (1) A census tract outside of a metropolitan statistical area, as designated by the Office of Management and Budget; or (2) A census tract in a metropolitan statistical area, as designated by the Office of Management and Budget, that is outside of the metropolitan statistical area‘s Urbanized Areas as designated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture‘s Rural-Urban Commuting Area Code #1, and outside of tracts with a housing density of over 64 housing units per square mile for USDA‘s RUCA Code #2.According to the CDFI Fund, the data file (which PolicyMap downloaded from the Fund‘s website), is the definitive source for determining whether a census tract qualifies as an area of High Housing Need.For more information about the Capital Magnet Fund data, see the CDFI Fund‘s website here.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/Programs/cmf/Pages/apply-step.aspx,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-1def0340-b2af-43e4-a870-dd0c6305a88a,Tabular Data,English,Community Development Financial Institutions Fund|US Department of the Treasury,Society|Capital Magnet Fund|Housing|Areas Of Economic Distress|Underserved Rural Areas,PolicyMap,2016|2018,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2018,1.0,GeoBlacklight

Schools whose coordinates fall outside the county in which they‘re listed are not displayed on the map.The GreatSchools Overall School Rating is a measure of overall school performance by state. The GreatSchools rating system is based on a score ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 having the highest performance. GreatSchools Summary Ratings are based on test scores, student or academic progress, college readiness, equity, advanced courses, and discipline and attendance disparities. In states where not all information is available, a rating based on test scores is given. GreatSchools ratings are designed to be a starting point to help parents compare schools, and should not be the only factor used in school selection. More information about GreatSchools Ratings can be found here. School ratings should not be compared across states, as they are relative to the state in which the school operates.For information about tests administered in each state, please see the Data Directory entry for GreatSchools School District Performance.GreatSchools School Points data is downloadable only for individual Census Tracts and Block Groups.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://www.greatschools.net,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-e90c3898-dd3e-449f-ba93-041698b760be,Tabular Data,English,,Society|Education,PolicyMap,2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2017,1.0,GeoBlacklight

596d1ebe-31f8-4cd7-9966-55ef974a2118,"Census Manufacturing, Mining and Construction Statistics","9,000 out of the 20,000 permit-issuing places submit the Form C-404 report “Report of Building or Zoning Permits Issued and Local Public Construction“on a monthly basis. The other places are surveyed only annually. The 9,000 surveyed monthly include: all permit-issuing places in the 75 Metropolitan Areas (MAs) with the largest number of permits (as of 2002); all permit-issuing places in states with limited numbers of permit-issuing places; permit-issuing places with special data reporting arrangements. The rest of the sample is stratified by state. Prior to 2005, monthly counts of building permits were based on a different sample of 8,500 out of 19,000 permit-issuing agencies. As a result, comparisons of building permit issuances between 2004 and 2005 should be made very cautiously.If a building permit report is not received for a given month or year, the missing data are either obtained from the Survey of Use of Permits (SUP) or imputed. The SUP is an annual survey of a smaller sample of permit-issuing areas that gathers data on housing construction, completion, sales, and characteristics of new housing.Monthly state and national data are estimates based on the sample data collected from the 9,000 permit-issuing agencies. For information on standard errors associated with these estimates see: http://www.census.gov/construction/bps/. Monthly county data are counts rather than estimates, and are therefore reported only for those counties where every permit office issues monthly reports. Annual data are obtained by summing monthly data reporters. If permit-issuing agencies submit both monthly and annual reports, the annual count is used. The annual building permit data on PolicyMap is unadjusted data.Building permit data will not accurately reflect construction activity in those areas where building permits are not issued. Nationally, only roughly 2 percent of housing starts are issued in areas not requiring permits, however this varies greatly state to state and region to region.",Restricted,https://www.policymap.com/maps,http://www.census.gov/construction/bps/,Dataset,Mixed,gbl-596d1ebe-31f8-4cd7-9966-55ef974a2118,Tabular Data,English,,Society|Census Manufacturing|Mining,PolicyMap,2018,United States,"ENVELOPE(-179.9,-64.4,71.6,-14.8)",2018,1.0,GeoBlacklight
