  "dc_description_s": "The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund is a division of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Per the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, funding was provided for several CDFI Fund programs (Bank Enterprise Award Program, CDFI Program, Healthy Food Financing Initiative, and Native American CDFI Assistance Program) on condition that a minimum of 10% of the projects served must be in persistent poverty counties. The legislation defines a persistent poverty county as any county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty for the past 30 years as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau. Based on this criteria, the CDFI Fund used data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses, and the 2011-2015 American Community Survey to determine qualifying counties.",
