  "dc_description_s": "The Location Affordability Index is a calculation designed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in order to estimate the costs of housing and transportation across the country. Data is provided on the percentage of household income spent on housing, transportation, and the combination of the two. Separate values are also offered for owner and renter households. Annual cost spent on transportation and annual total public transit trips are also included.HUD\u2018s methodology was significantly updated in Version 3 of the Location Affordability Index Model (LAIM), which was released in March of 2019. The biggest difference between Version 2 and 3 of the LAIM was the reduction in geographies available and Version 3 only modelled results for Census Tracts.HUD uses different calculations for eight different types of households, with different sizes, incomes, and number of commuters. They are defined as follows: HOUSEHOLD TYPE|SIZE OF HH|INCOME|# COMMUTERS||Median-Income Family|4|Median Income for Region|2||Very Low-Income Individual|1|National Poverty Line|1||Working Individual|1|50% of Median Income for Region|1||Single Professional|1|135% of Median Income for Region|1||Retired Couple|2|80% of Median Income for Region|0||Single-Parent Family|3|50% of Median Income for Region|1||Moderate Income Family|3|80% of Median Income for Region|1||Dual-Professional Family|4|150% of Median Income for Region|2||The LAIM Version 3 was produced from U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016 survey data, U.S. Census TIGER files, and the U.S. Census Longitudinal Employment-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) and OnTheMap 7 data, which was built on 2014 Census data. Since this study was released by HUD in 2019, that is the data year given on PolicyMap.A very thorough explanation of the calculations made by HUD are available here: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/location-affordability-index/.",
