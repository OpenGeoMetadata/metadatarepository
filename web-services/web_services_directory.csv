0	1da01b9b-4bfb-48fc-8444-ef61cab82bef	Anti-Eviction Mapping Project	The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project is a data-visualization, data analysis, and storytelling collective documenting dispossession and resistance upon gentrifying landscapes. Primarily working in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York City, we are all volunteers producing digital maps, oral history work, film, murals, and community events. Working with a number of community partners and in solidarity with numerous housing movements, we study and visualize new entanglements of global capital, real estate, technocapitalism, and political economy. Our narrative oral history and video work centers the displacement of people and complex social worlds, but also modes of resistance. Maintaining antiracist and feminist analyses as well as decolonial methodology, the project creates tools and disseminates data contributing to collective resistance and movement building.

We initially began in North America and have spread increasingly worldwide, and new areas are added regularly. This tool is not meant to be an official, legal, or archival resource. It is instead a broadly researched and crowdsourced body of information. It is meant to encourage education and engagement on topics of Indigenous land‚Äîparticularly, where you are located. Native Land brings about discussions of colonization, land rights, language, and Indigenous history tied to our personal histories. We hope this guide makes you, the reader, want to know about the land you live on.

We also drew on published lists of lynching victims from historians (Barrow 2005; Campney 2008, 2018; Carrigan 2004; Carrigan and Webb 2013; Downey 2013; Downey and Hyser 2011; Frazier 2015; Pfeifer 2011, 2013; Williams 2001). Our data include every lynching victim we were able to locate and confirm with local newspapers from 1883 to 1941 in the 38 contiguous U.S. states not included in the original Tolnay-Beck data. We coded each lynching for the size of the mob, the race and gender of the victim, the alleged offense claimed to have incited the mob, and the method by which the mob murdered the victim.
