Data are supplied by state education agency officials. School district data was downloaded from the Elementary/Secondary Information System (ElSi), available at http:/ces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/. Percentages calculated by PolicyMap (such as percent of students who are English Language Learners) were suppressed where the numerator was greater than the denominator (such as when a school district reported more English Language Learners than total students).",
