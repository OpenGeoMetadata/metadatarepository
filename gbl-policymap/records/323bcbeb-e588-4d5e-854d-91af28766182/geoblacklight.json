  "dc_description_s": "PolicyMap calculated the shortest distance within 50 miles to a public school with a GreatSchools Overall School Rating of 9 or 10 for each Census Tract in the same state. This representation of access to high performing public schools is limited by the fact that GreatSchools does not assign a rating to every public school in the nation. GreatSchools school ratings should not be compared across states; as such, a public school with a 9 or a 10 in one state may not be comparable to a public school with a 9 or a 10 in another state. This analysis does not take into account political boundaries or catchment areas within states that may make a public school inaccessible.",
